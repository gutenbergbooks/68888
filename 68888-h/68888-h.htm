PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
There is a glamour and romance about war that appeals to the
heart of every young man worthy of the name in these islands.
This is as it should be.  We are a nation of sailors, it is true,
but many a blood-red field can bear witness that we are soldiers
also, when we have the right man to lead us.
</p>

<p>
A weapon, however, that is left too long in its scabbard is apt
to rust therein.  This was the state in which we found the British
sword when the fiery cross was sent round in 1853.  We had not
been at war for forty years before this, and even many of our
generals had forgotten all about the art.  Hence the terrible
muddle and mismanagement witnessed in the Crimea.  Our poor
fellows were positively sent off as empty-handed as if going to a
grand parade or soldiers' picnic, and indeed but for individual
courage, and good luck, the invasion would have ended in
national disaster and disgrace, for us as well as for our brave
allies the French.
</p>

<p>
I have no desire to dispel the romance that surrounds as with
a halo the noble and necessary art of war.  But I think every
young fellow should know that to be a real soldier it is necessary
for him to be not only a fighting man and a brave man in the
field, but a perfect camp's-man also; and he can never learn to
be so in barracks, but on the tented field, in times of peace.
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason that the sailor, if I may be allowed to say
a word in favour of the service to which I belong, makes the best
soldier.  Captain Peel's brigade proved this in the trenches.
</p>

<p>
In the second book of this story, the youthful reader will find
fighting and bloodshed enough, and horrors too.  But the tale is
all true, sadly, terribly true.  Hear what Sir Evelyn Wood says:
"It may be asked, Why recall these dismal stories?  Because
...... to the present generation our hideous sacrifice of soldiers in the
Crimea is but little more known than the sufferings of our
troops at Walcheren and in the Peninsula.  I believe in the
advantage of telling those who elect parliamentary representatives
what has happened and what may happen again, unless a high
standard of administrative efficiency is maintained.  This cannot
be attained unless the necessary departments are practised in
their duties during peace."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p class="poem">
"Peace hath her victories, no less renowned than war."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In my first book, then, I have endeavoured to give a sketch of
the sailor's life in the piping times of peace, and most of the
sketches and little adventures and yarns are drawn from the life.
Dr. Reikie, who is constantly in the pursuit of science under
difficulties, was a real character.  So were Sturdy, Gribble, Fitzgerald,
Captain Gillespie, and the marine Paddy O'Bayne.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
WEE JOHNNIE GREYBREEKS.
</h3>

<p>
It was what is called a real old-fashioned Yuletide.
The snow had been falling, falling, falling
all day long; it had begun at grey daylight in the
morning, in little pellets like millet seed, which lay
white and unmelted on the frozen pavements.  But as
the hours went by, these were changed for flakes as
big and broad as butterflies' wings, that fell fast and
"eident" all the day; and that night the more
aristocratic thoroughfares of Glasgow were as silent as a
city of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Not that they were deserted by any means, for
passengers flitted about in garments draped with snow,
and snow-laden cabs drove past, but not a sound could
be heard from hoof of horse or foot of man.
</p>

<p>
It was not cold, however.  There was no high wind
to powder the flakes or grind them into ice-dust, or
raise wreaths along the pathways; and so pure was
the air, that but to breathe it for a little while was to
purify every drop of blood in one's body from heart
to head and heels, to heighten the vital flame, and to
make one feel as happy and contented as one should
ever be about a Christmas time.
</p>

<p>
From the windows of many a beautiful villa in this
picture of a winter's night there shone, directly out
upon the snow-clad lawns and ghost-like bushes, the
ruddy light of cosily-furnished rooms, where rosy
children romped and played, while around the fire sat
their elders, "doucely" talking about the days of
"auld lang syne."
</p>

<p>
One room in a villa of larger size and more pretentious
architecture than its fellows looked particularly
bright and cheerful.  It was tastefully furnished, and
here and there in corners stood tall lamps with
coloured shades, while in the centre was placed a
lordly Christmas tree.  No wonder that the ring of
prettily-attired children around gazed with admiration
on this masterpiece of decoration.  It was indeed
very beautiful, its green and spreading branches laden
with light and the sunshine of a hundred toys.
</p>

<p>
But listen! the music of a piano and harp strikes
up, and now the children, big and little, join hands
and go daftly dancing round the tree.  Till one wee
toddler tumbles; then the ring is broken, and half a
dozen at least are piled on top of her.  The very house
seems to shake now with the sound of mirth and
laughter, the shrill treble of the youngsters receiving
a deep and hearty bass in the voices of two
jolly-looking elderly gentlemen, who are standing on the
hearth with their backs to the fire.
</p>

<p>
But once again the ring is formed, once again the
music that had been partially interrupted is heard,
and once again the children dance jubilantly round,
madder and wilder now than ever, singing,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Here we go round and round and round,<br />
  Here we go round the Christmas tree."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The elderly gentlemen who stood with their backs
to the fire were spectators of all this fun, frolic, and
jollity.  But they were not the only ones.
</p>

<p>
For past the broad and open gate, as he had been
creeping through the snow&mdash;oh so slowly and
wearily&mdash;a tiny boy, attracted by the sound of the gladsome
voices, had paused to listen.  Listening or looking is
such a cheap pleasure that even the very poorest can
indulge in it.  The snowflakes had for a time ceased
falling, and from behind a mass of clouds the moon
was struggling.  But the red rays from the window
more than rivalled its splendour, and very inviting
indeed did they appear to the little wanderer.  He
first looked in through the gate, then he crept in
through it.  Nearer and nearer to the window, closer
and closer to the joy within, till the lamplight shone
directly on his white, pinched face, and glittered in
his dark and wondering eyes, as he stood there keeping
hold of a snowy branch with one hand, as if afraid
of falling.
</p>

<p>
To listen and to look on while the rich enjoy
themselves&mdash;oh yes, these are the privileges of the very
poor!  But somehow on the present occasion little
Jack Mackenzie was doing more than simply listening
and looking.  Quite unintentionally, remember.  He
was associating himself with all the games and
pleasure inside the room.  He was no longer a thinly-clothed,
bare-footed laddie, shivering in the winter's
snow; he was one of that prettily-dressed crowd of
beautiful children playing around the Christmas tree.
Fairies he called them in his own mind; for he had
once been treated to a gallery seat at a pantomime,
and this was just like that, only ever so much more
beautiful and natural.  No wonder he felt interested
and entranced, or that several times his lips parted to
give utterance to the exclamation "Oh!" though he
always restrained himself in time.
</p>

<p>
Was it any wonder this poor, half-starved boy was
delighted with the scene before him?  It was, he
thought, as different from what he was used to behold
in that part of the city he called his home, as the
heaven his mother often spoke about must be from
earth&mdash;that heaven to which his father had gone,
long, long, long ago, so long ago that he couldn't
remember him, and always thought of him only as a
saint Up Yonder somewhere, where he himself would
go one day if he was good.
</p>

<p>
So completely are Jack Mackenzie's senses
enthralled, that he does not hear the sound of a manly
voice singing adown the broad terrace, but coming
nearer and nearer every moment,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,<br />
  Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.<br />
  A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,<br />
  Which seek through the world is ne'er met with elsewhere.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home, home, etc.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "An exile from home, splendour dazzles in vain:<br />
  O give me my lowly thatched cottage again!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
No, Jack doesn't hear the song.  Nor does he
see the singer, until he is suddenly caught by one
shoulder and wheeled right round to confront a
well-dressed and handsome man with a huge brown
beard, on which melted snow-flakes sparkle like
diamonds.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! hullo! so I've caught you, have I?"  The
new-comer had bent down, and was gazing straight
into Jack's face.
</p>

<p>
"Caught me, sir!" replied the boy, with fearless
innocence; "did&mdash;did you want to catch me, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Want to catch you, you young rascal!  Come,
give an account of yourself.  What are you?  A
burglar's boy, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked a little puzzled.  He put his hand up
as if to feel that his cap was on.  It was only a little
old glengarry, with a hole where the top used to be,
and through which a lock of the lad's hair always
straggled.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I'm nothing yet.  Was you looking for
somebody to be a burglar's boy, sir?  I would be it
if it was nice.  I want to work for mother and Siss,
you know.  But what do burglars do, sir?  Mind,
I'm not afraid of work, and I might get shoes and
stockings then."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he held up one red and swollen foot.
Not that he was courting sympathy.  Oh no; only
standing in the snow had made his feet cold.
</p>

<p>
"O you poor wee ragamuffin, are you really so
destitute as all that, and on Christmas eve too?  Come
now, tell me your name and what you were after, and
if it is all right I'll give you a penny and let you go."
</p>

<p>
"My name is Jack Mackenzie, sir; but mebbe, sir,
you would know me better as little Johnnie Greybreeks,
because that's what the boys all call me."
</p>

<p>
The big man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Me know you!  Well, that's good.  But what
were you doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried the lad ecstatically, "I was looking in
there at the fairies.  O sir, isn't it grand and
beautiful?  If you stand here you can have a see too.  They
won't notice us."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!  Well, but suppose I don't want to have
a 'see,' as you call it; suppose I live here?"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie didn't answer immediately.  He heaved a
big, double sort of a sigh, and on his eyelashes
something appeared that glittered in the light like the
melted snow-flakes on the stranger's brown beard.
</p>

<p>
"I wish my mother and Siss lived in there."
</p>

<p>
There was a ring of genuine sadness and pathos in
the boy's voice that went straight to that tall man's
heart, and he would not have trusted himself to speak
just then for a good deal.  He felt certain in his own
mind that this poor, ragged lad was speaking the
truth.  Then he pictured to himself the contrast
between the very poor and the rich in such a city as
this.  How could he help doing so, when he glanced
from the white and weary face before him to the
happy children at their innocent gambols within?
</p>

<p>
"It is a contrast," he murmured to himself, "that
Heaven permits for some good purpose, though it is
all dark, dark to my limited mental vision."
</p>

<p>
But, happy thought! he could do something even
to-night to soothe the sorrows and sufferings of this
one wee waif before him.  It was Christmas eve too.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, boy," he said first, "how comes it that
you can talk such good English?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I'm talking to a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"But can't you speak broad Scotch?"
</p>

<p>
"Bonnie yon, to the wee callants on the street.  But
mother makes us&mdash;Siss and me&mdash;speak English at
home."
</p>

<p>
"And what does your father do?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-012"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-012.jpg" alt="He crept nearer and nearer to the window." />
<br />
He crept nearer and nearer to the window.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father's gone to heaven, you know, sir.  He's
going to stop there always."
</p>

<p>
"Does your mother&mdash;er&mdash;wash or char or anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, sir; mother's a real lady."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tom Morgan&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Now show me your hands.  Why, they are quite
clean!  There, give me one, and now march along
with me."
</p>

<p>
Jack drew back hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope, sir," he said, with tears in his voice, "I
haven't done any harm?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, lad; I'm going to give you supper and
send you off.  Come."
</p>

<p>
Somehow, lines from Thorn's beautiful poem "The
Mitherless Bairn" were borne to Mr. Morgan's mind,
as he led the boy round through the garden to the
back door of the villa.
</p>

<p>
Jack was not mitherless, but in other respects he
resembled the subject of the sad song.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh speak him not harshly&mdash;he trembles the while&mdash;<br />
  He bends to your bidding and blesses your smile:<br />
  In their dark hour o' anguish the heartless shall learn<br />
  That God deals the blow for the mitherless bairn."<br />

<p>
When little Johnnie Greybreeks had left his
mother's room that evening, he had been on business
bent.  Business of a very important description, I can
assure you, reader.  Important to Johnnie, at all events.
A few weeks before this, when wandering in the
western outskirts of the town, which at the time
our story commences&mdash;namely, away back in 1849&mdash;were
beautifully wooded and with very few houses
indeed to be seen, he had come upon the ruined walls
of a mansion that had been destroyed by fire.  It
was open to the road, and probably people as poor as
Johnnie had been here before, for every rag and piece
of wood had been carried away.  But to the boy's
delight he had come across an ash heap, over which a
large elder tree drooped, half hiding it, and here were
at least two dozen medicine-bottles, many smashed
but many whole.  What a find if they could only be
his!  Next day he had wandered that way again, and
was glad to find a man there who was about to clear
the heap.  The man laughed when Johnnie volunteered
his assistance, but for sake of company, he said,
permitted the boy to help him.  The job was finished in
a couple of hours, and Johnnie had the bottles as his
wages.
</p>

<p>
He took as many as he could down to the burn
and washed them, then came back for more, and
by-and-by they were all nice and clean and hidden away
where he was sure no one could find them but himself.
Then a good-natured chemist in the street where the
boy lived had promised him ninepence for the lot.
Ninepence! what a fortune!  He had never seen so
much money before.  When he got it, he tied it up in
a handkerchief&mdash;it was all in pennies and half-pennies&mdash;and
resolved not to tell his mother till Christmas
eve, when he would go quietly out and purchase
something nice for next day's dinner.
</p>

<p>
And it was with the view of making these purchases
that Johnnie had come out to-night.  He had
come too early though, for in the shops he was to
favour with his custom, things were never at their
very cheapest till nearly closing-time.  So he had
treated himself to a walk in the west end.
</p>

<p>
Then the snow began to fall, and we know the rest.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tom Morgan had his reasons for taking Johnnie
in by the back door and through the kitchen.  He
really wanted to know if the boy was in the slightest
degree presentable.
</p>

<p>
He was better pleased with his appearance than he
had expected to be.  Johnnie's nether garments of
hodden grey were patched at the knees and tattered
and short at the ankles; his jacket was torn, too, and
out at the elbows; but the lad was clean, even to his
shirt, which left neck and red chest exposed to the
weather.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie's features were regular and far from
unpleasant, but his dark eyes were very large and sad.
</p>

<p>
"You'll do, lad, you'll do.  Come along; it is Christmas
eve, and mother is kind anyhow."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
LIFE IN SUMMER LOANING.
</h3>

<p>
"O children," cried old Mrs. Morgan during
a lull in the frolicsome riot, "here comes
your uncle Tom.  I can hear his voice in the hall.
Now we'll have a song and a dance!"
</p>

<p>
She rose and walked towards the drawing-room
door, and the bairns crowded after, with joyful,
expectant faces.
</p>

<p>
But when the door was opened, and they found
Uncle Tom standing there holding little ragged
Johnnie by the hand, astonishment and wonder
seemed to deprive everybody of speech.  Miss
Scraggs, an elderly spinster, nearly fainted.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth&mdash;" began one elderly gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"As I live&mdash;-" exclaimed the other.
</p>

<p>
Neither got any further, but both burst into a
hearty fit of laughing.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Morgan, Tom's mother, found voice first.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," she cried, "who or what have you gotten
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, mother, I couldn't say&mdash;at least, not
exactly.  He is a sort of mitherless bairn&mdash;well, not
exactly that either, because he has a mother, but no
father.  And you see how poor the child is.  Look
at his naked feet, mother and children all, and we so
happy and jolly and everything.  And this Christmas
eve, too, mother.  I thought we might&mdash;that is, I
might&mdash;do some little thing for him&mdash;a supper, or
anything like that&mdash;and then send him home."
</p>

<p>
"My own good-hearted Tom!" said the old lady,
smiling.  "And did you pick him up in the street?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not exactly in the street, mother.  Fact
is, he was in the grounds, and looking in at the
window."
</p>

<p>
"In the grounds, Tom!  Oh, do you think he was
after the spoons, or&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No, no, dear mother," interrupted the stalwart
son.  "He was peeping in at the dancing and the
Christmas tree.  He said the children were just like
fairies."
</p>

<p>
"Droll boy.  What is his name?  Jack?&mdash;When
did you see fairies?"
</p>

<p>
"When I was a god, big lady."
</p>

<p>
"When you were what?"
</p>

<p>
"He means," said Mr. Tom Morgan, "when he had
a seat in the gallery of the theatre at a pantomime,
I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.&mdash;Are you a good boy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, ma'am; very wicked.  For 'there is none
that doeth good and sinneth not, no, not one.'"
</p>

<p>
The elderly men-people behind laughed loudly and
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of that, Dawson?" said one,
nudging the other in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Good, good!&mdash;Capital, Mrs. Morgan!"
</p>

<p>
But Miss Scraggs said, "Dreadful!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to be when you grow up
to manhood?" continued Mrs. Morgan.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite sure, big lady.  I think I'd like
to be a bu'glar."
</p>

<p>
It is no wonder that Miss Scraggs screamed, or that
"big lady" lifted up her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, take the dreadful creature away!" cried Miss
Scraggs; "he may kill us all before morning."
</p>

<p>
But when Tom Morgan laughingly explained that
poor little Jack knew not what he was saying, and
had no idea what a burglar was, he was restored to
favour.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom," said the elder Mr. Morgan, who was
Tom's father, "take your little sans-culotte away
and give him a feed.  I'll warrant he won't say 'no'
to that on a Christmas eve."
</p>

<p>
"And some dood tlothes too," lisped a wee maiden
of six&mdash;"some dood tlothes, Uncle Tom."
</p>

<p>
Then Jack made a bow such as he had seen actors
outside caravans in the Green make.  He took off
the remains of his glengarry solemnly with his right
hand, put his left hand to his heart, and bent his
body low.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Morgan," cried Dawson, as Tom led Jack
off, "that isn't any ordinary boy.  Blame me if I
don't think there are the makings of a little
gentleman about him.  What think you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Dawson, you never can tell what a boy
of that age may turn to or be.  He might turn out
a burning and a shining light in church or state,
he might become a leader of armies, or he might
give&mdash;Jack Ketch a job."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Young Tom Morgan&mdash;for he was not above four-and-twenty,
although his beard was so big and strong&mdash;was
the younger of two sons who both lived with
their parents, the house being very large.  The elder
son, Grant Morgan, was married, and occupied the
northern wing with his wife and three children.  The
wee lass who had proposed that Jack or Johnnie
should have "dood tlothes" was the youngest; then
there was a boy of eight and one of eleven.
</p>

<p>
When Tom returned to the servants' hall, he succeeded
in interesting every one there, even the somewhat
supercilious butler, in Johnnie Greybreeks; and
between the lot of them they succeeded in working
quite a transformation in the boy.  In fact, they
took great fun in doing it.
</p>

<p>
"Ulric's clothes will just fit him, cook," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother the 'but'! this is Christmas eve,
cook.  There, now; you take him into your own
room and see to his hair and his poor little feet.
I'll be back in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour after this nobody would have taken
Johnnie for the same boy, but for his pale face and
sad, dark, wondering eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to go away with all these grand
things on, am I, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you are."
</p>

<p>
"I can go to church now!" cried Jack jubilantly.
"I tried one time before; but they thought I'd come
after the coppers, and chased me away.  O sir,
mother and Sissie will be pleased; you've made such
a happy boy of me!"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie began bundling up his old clothes in his
red handkerchief as he spoke; and when he departed,
about an hour after this, he took that bundle with
him, and another too, containing more provisions and
nice things than would do for several days' dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Johnnie Greybreeks&mdash;" began Tom Morgan.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you please, sir," said Johnnie, "that is only
my <i>sobriquet</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack, then," laughed Tom, "I'm going to
take you to have a look at the Christmas tree, and
it is just possible you may have something off it
for your Siss&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's heart was too full to speak, and there were
tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Everybody said that Miss Scraggs was cocking her
cap at young Tom Morgan, though everybody took
care to add that she was old enough to be his
grand&mdash;well, his aunt at least.  Tom could not
stand her.  Not that he hated her&mdash;he was too
good-hearted to hate anybody&mdash;but he just gave her
a wide berth, as we say at sea.
</p>

<p>
But when he returned to the drawing-room with
the intention of placing his little <i>protégé</i> in a corner
to look at the fun for a few minutes, Tom had his
revenge, for he had not felt pleased at the way Miss
Scraggs talked to or at the poor ragged boy.
</p>

<p>
The spinster lady happened to be standing near
to the door when Tom entered.  She did not see
Jack just at once, but as soon as she did she smiled
most condescendingly on him.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, my little friend?  I know your
face, but can't recollect where I've had the pleasure
of seeing you before.&mdash;Oh, goodness gracious!" she
cried immediately after; "it's the horrid little
burglar boy!"
</p>

<p>
It was rude of Mr. Dawson and Tom Morgan to
laugh so loudly, but they could not help it.  As for
poor Jack, he crimsoned to the very roots of his
hair.  I think there is always some good about a
boy who can blush.  However, Jack never forgot
Miss Scraggs.  But he thought no more about it for
the present, because wee Violet Morgan tripped up
to speak to him.  There was no pride about Violet.
</p>

<p>
"So," she said, "you's dot you dood tlothes on.
You is so pletty now I tould almost tiss you."
</p>

<p>
"Violet!" screamed Miss Scraggs; "come here this
instant."
</p>

<p>
But Violet had a will of her own; besides, it was
Christmas eve, and she had a right to do whatever
she pleased.
</p>

<p>
"I won't tome there this instant," she said, stamping
her tiny foot; "this is Tlismas eve, and 'ittle
dirls can do as they pleases, Miss Staggs."
</p>

<p>
But all eyes were now drawn towards Violet and
Jack, and there was momentary silence.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Morgan," cried Dawson, loud enough for
every one to hear, "did ever you, in all your life,
see such a remarkable resemblance?"
</p>

<p>
"'Pon honour, Dawson, I never did!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Violet and that little fellow might be sister
and brother!"
</p>

<p>
Same contour, same hair, same eyes, same everything.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! hush!" said Mr. Morgan the elder; "remember
the boy's station in life."
</p>

<p>
Jack drew back into his corner a little abashed.
Half an hour afterwards, when Tom went round that
way, the child stole his hand softly into the
brown-bearded big man's.
</p>

<p>
"Take me away now," he beseeched; "I'm tired."
</p>

<p>
The fun was then getting fast and furious; but
Tom and the boy slipped out as quietly as they had
come, and in a few minutes more Johnnie Greybreeks
found himself once more out in the snow.  As he
passed through the gate, he paused to look back.
</p>

<p>
"Heigh-ho!" he sighed; "I've been in fairy-land.
What a story I should have to tell mother and Siss!
only, long before I get home I shall wake and find
it is all a dream."
</p>

<p>
Then away he went, feathering through the snow,
and keeping a good hold on his bundle, but
nevertheless expecting every minute to awake and find
himself in his own bed.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say that Jack didn't awake, and
that his adventure wasn't a dream; and it is quite
impossible to describe the astonishment of his mother
and sister when he told all his wonderful story.
</p>

<p>
That Christmas dinner, next day, was the best
and most delightful ever Jack or his little sister
Maggie could remember partaking of since they had
come to reside at No. 73 Summer Loaning.
</p>

<p>
Summer Loaning, indeed! what a cruel misnomer!
Well, to be sure, there might have been a time away
back in the past when this street was a kind of
loaning, or even a lover's lane leading right away
out into the cool country.  Green hedges might have
grown where now stood houses gaunt and grey and
grim; hedges of wild hawthorn, trailed over in
summer-time with dog-roses pink and red; hedges in
which birds in early spring may have sung&mdash;the
sweet wee linnet, the spotted mavis, the mellow
blackbird, or madly-lilting chaffinch.  Trees, too,
may have waved their branches over Summer
Loaning&mdash;the rustling ash and the oak and chestnut, and
the spreading rowan to which the poet sings and
says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thy leaves were aye the first o' spring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy flowers the simmer's pride;<br />
  There wasna sic a bonnie tree<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a' the country-side."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Yes, this may have been the case long, long ago; but
now, alas! the change.
</p>

<p>
Summer Loaning went straggling up a hill, or brae,
for fully half a mile, and one glance at the street
would have convinced you that, although not a slum
by any means, it was the abode of the hard-working
poor.  People lived here on landings and flats, many
families occupying but two rooms, many having to
content themselves with only one.  The common
stairways, generally of stone, went winding up and
up from closes&mdash;called in England courts&mdash;often five
or even six stories high.  If the landlord of these
tenements happened to be a good sort of a fellow,
then the staircases might be lighted in winter by
tiny jets of gas no bigger than farthing rush-lights;
but as often as not they were shrouded in darkness
and gloom, and the dwellers in these stone castles
had to "glamp" their way up, as it is called, by
feeling along the damp, cold walls.
</p>

<p>
There was poverty enough, though, in Summer
Loaning when sickness came, or when the want of
work induced it; for trouble haunts the abodes of
the hungry and needful.  Many a little coffin, in
times like these, was manoeuvred down those steep
stone stairs, and borne quietly away to the cemetery
or Necropolis, which was not a great distance off.
Usually a few neighbours went along, and then a
kind of funeral procession would be formed.  But
often, when the coffin was very tiny indeed, the
father himself would trudge along with it under
his arm, accompanied, perhaps, by his sad-eyed wife;
both dressed in black clothes that, more than likely,
had been borrowed from kindly neighbours for the
occasion.  Yes, I said kindly neighbours; for the
poor to the poor are ever kind.
</p>

<p>
This was the sort of neighbourhood in which
Jack Mackenzie had hitherto spent most of his young
days.  And hard indeed his life had been, pinched
for food, ragged in clothes, and often cold as well
as hungry.  Jack had never been to school in his
life; but his mother, though in poverty now, had seen
far better days, and right well she knew the
advantage of a good education in enabling either boy
or man to do battle with the world, and so she spent
half her time in teaching her two children.  It was
stitch, stitch, stitch with her now all day long just
to get ends to meet.  From her poor, thin face
you might have said she was not long for this
world, and that while sewing at a shirt she was
making her shroud.  But even while at work, Jack
and his sister would be busy at their books, or with
their slates.
</p>

<p>
They lived in one room, and every article in it
betokened poverty, although all was cleanly.  The
ferns and flowers in the window above the "jaw-box,"
where water was drawn and toilets performed,
threw a little of nature into this poor apartment,
and a solitary canary made it even cheerful, for he
sang as joyously as if his cage had been of gilded
wire and all his surroundings the best in the city.
Neither of the children was unhappy, and they
dearly loved their mother.  They never grumbled,
either, at their scanty fare&mdash;and, O dear reader,
it was scanty enough at times.  A little oatmeal
porridge washed down with a halfpennyworth of blue
skimmed milk was all their breakfast; and their
supper, too, was much the same.
</p>

<p>
But Jack was a brave provider, and a capital
hand at marketing.  No one knew better than he
how to make a bargain, or how far six or seven
pence would go in the purchase of meal, coals,
herrings, and a little tea and sugar for mother.  In
fact, the whole outdoor management of the family
devolved upon little Johnnie Greybreeks, as
everybody on the great staircase called him.  And very
proud indeed he was to be looked upon as purser
or paymaster.  Often his sister went out with him
on his foraging expeditions; but although she was
some years older than Johnnie, she had not the
boy's knowledge of the world and of mankind.  It
seems almost ridiculous to talk of a boy of eight
years of age knowing anything about the world;
but poverty sharpens the wits, I do assure you.
</p>

<p>
It is said that poverty is a hard taskmaster.
Well, perhaps,&mdash;and doubtless it is a very exacting
one; but, nevertheless, some of the greatest geniuses,
generals, statesmen, and thinkers have been brought
up in just such schools as Johnnie's, and have been
all the better for it.  So poor boys must never let
down their hearts, but just work, work, work; read,
read, read; and think, think, think.  Remember the
story of Dick Whittington.  It is only a kind of
fairy romance, you may tell me.  Ah! but there
is a deal of truth in it; and some very poor lads
have become presidents even of the great American
republic, and a president is a cut above Lord Mayor
of London.  So, hurrah! who cares for poverty?
Don't forget those spirited lines of Robbie Burns,
the great Scottish poet.  Yes, Scottish poet, but the
British people's poet as well, and the poet of the
people of every country where true freedom reigns.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
MRS. MALONY'S WEDDING-RING.
</h3>

<p>
Poor Mrs. Mackenzie's story had been a very sad
one.  And it was one that is, alas! too common.
It does not take long to tell.
</p>

<p>
She had been well educated and delicately reared
in the lap of wealth and luxury.  She was an old
man's only child, and her father considered there was
nothing on earth too good for her.  When the girl
was about sixteen, her father was in the heyday of
success in life.  A speculator he was, and lived in a
beautiful house on the Borders, and on the banks of
the winding Tweed.  He was very much looked up
to, as wealthy men generally are, simply because they
are wealthy.  But to have seen Mr. Noble's house
and grounds, his retinue of servants and his carriages
and horses, would have caused you to think, as
everybody else thought, "Here is a man that can never
be moved."
</p>

<p>
At this time, or soon after, he had a winter
establishment in Edinburgh, and used to give as good
parties as any lord in the city; and Euphemia&mdash;his
daughter, and she had no mother&mdash;used to be the
presiding goddess.  She was very beautiful; she is
beautiful even as we know her now, though poverty
and want have hollowed her cheeks, and given a
lustre to her dark eyes that her good neighbours on
the stair say is hardly "canny."
</p>

<p>
Euphemia, when only seventeen, had several suitors
for her hand, and might have made what is called a
very good match.  But there was one she cared for
above them all.  He was a dashing young officer of
a Highland regiment at that time stationed in the
Castle.
</p>

<p>
The two became engaged.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Mackenzie was of very good family, and
would one day be wealthy; only just at that time he
had nothing but his pay, his prospects, and the
allowance his mother made him.  He couldn't afford to
marry for some time.  What did that matter? they
were both young, and could wait.
</p>

<p>
So away went the gallant 93rd to India, and with
it went Lieutenant Donald Mackenzie, with hope and
love to buoy up his heart.
</p>

<p>
He had not been away a year before a crisis came,
and then a crash&mdash;oh, such a terrible crash!  I
suppose Mr. Noble had got too daring, or too something
or other, in his speculations.  I really do not
know all the outs and ins of the matter, but I do
know that his house and all his property, down even
to Euphemia's pet canaries, were sold, and that after
this poor Mr. Noble&mdash;poor now indeed&mdash;had barely
enough to pay the passage-money for himself and
daughter to America, where, with the help of some
friends or distant relatives, he intended to start
afresh.  Just think of it&mdash;an old man of seventy
starting life afresh!
</p>

<p>
Well, the end seemed to have come, indeed, when
Euphie's father died.  She was a brave Scotch lassie,
however, and would not give in; so she wrote to
India to Donald&mdash;her Donald now no longer&mdash;releasing
him from his engagement, then she hired herself
out as a governess.
</p>

<p>
Donald's regiment fought in Afghanistan and the
borders of India, and he was wounded.  He lost his
left arm, brave fellow, and was sent home to be
invalided, and retired.
</p>

<p>
A whole year passed away, and Donald lived at his
mother's Highland home&mdash;Drumglen&mdash;an estate that
had been left entirely to her, to will or to do with it
as she pleased.  Donald was the only son, and a very
great favourite.  She, the mother, too, was exceedingly
jealous of his attentions to any fair maiden that
she did not approve of.  In fact, she had her eye
upon a lady who would make a capital wife for her
son.  A little older, it is true.  What did that matter,
the mother told herself; she would be all the more
fitted to advise and guide her son through life.
Rather dark and stately, too, she was, not to say
forbidding.  But she owned broad Highland acres, and
moorlands, forests, and glens.  The absence of beauty,
Donald's mother thought, would be an advantage
rather than otherwise, for Donald could not well be
jealous of a wife ugly enough to stop the church
clock.
</p>

<p>
But, woe is me!  Donald still languished and prayed
for Euphemia Noble.  And one day in Glasgow, lo,
he met her!  She was only a governess to some very
young children.  What of that?  All Donald's love
returned in double force, and he determined to marry her.
</p>

<p>
It is the old story: the girl consented at last.  Then
Donald tried to win his mother over.  But that stern
Highland dowager was inexorable.  If he married
this wretched governess&mdash;doubtless some designing
minx and hussy&mdash;he should never again darken the
doors of Drumglen.
</p>

<p>
Donald looked at her in sadness and sorrow, and
though one sleeve was empty, a very gallant and
soldierly man he was.  But there was no relenting in
his tall, stern, and dignified mother.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
That was all Donald either said or sighed.  He
just turned on his heel and walked away as he
was&mdash;and never once looked back.
</p>

<p>
The mother gazed after him through the window,
till the trees hid him from her view; then she shut
herself up in her rooms for days, and no one, not
even her maid, knew all that proud woman suffered
during this time.
</p>

<p>
After her marriage with her one-armed soldier,
Euphemia and he lived in a tiny cottage down the
Clyde.  They were so poor that it was difficult indeed
to get ends to meet, even in a semi-genteel kind of
way.  But they were rich in each other's love.  And
so they struggled on and on for years.
</p>

<p>
Alas that I should have to tell it!  Lieutenant
Mackenzie in an evil hour was induced to enter the
betting ring.  From that hour his downfall may have
been dated.  It is too sad a story to tell.  Instead of
the pretty little cottage on the banks of the romantic
Clyde, his wife and he were soon occupying rooms in
a somewhat squalid quarter of great Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
How it happened I do not know, but one evening
Donald was missing, and he did not return all the
next day; but in the gloom of the gloaming a strange
man called on Mrs. Mackenzie, and when she saw him
she burst at once into an agony of grief that cannot
easily be described.
</p>

<p>
It ended in her leaving her two children to the
charge of a neighbour and going away in a cab with
the stranger&mdash;to a mortuary.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that was he&mdash;that was Donald, pale and
draggled and dead; her Donald, with his poor, empty
sleeve pinned across his breast!
</p>

<p>
Oh the pity of it! oh the anguish!  But there,
the curtain drops on that act, and I am glad it does.
Let me just add that ill-health after this reduced
Mrs. Mackenzie more and more, till we find her living
in this one room, her boy and girl alone to cheer her,
and give her some little excuse for hanging on to life.
</p>

<p>
But compared with many of the large houses in
many parts of Glasgow, No. 73 Summer Loaning was
very quiet.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was quiet, except perhaps on a Saturday night,
when, it must be conceded, one or two working-men
did come up the long stone stair singing to themselves.
Although a lady by birth and education, Mrs. Mackenzie,
in her one room, did not keep all her neighbours
at bay.  They called her the "shuestress,"
which is a kind of Scotch for dressmaker.  They
knew she had seen far better days, and that she was
poorer now than any of them, because she was unable
to do much work.  As the song says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The poor make no new friends,<br />
  But ah! they love the better far<br />
  The few the Father sends."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, it might be thought by some that, for sake of
her children, Mrs. Mackenzie ought to have written to
her late husband's mother or rich relations, and asked
for help.
</p>

<p>
Asked for help?  No, a thousand times no; that
would have been begging!  Mrs. Mackenzie was far
too proud to do that.  Sooner would she die.  But
her pride did not forbid her from courting the
companionship of the neighbours on the stair.  If they
were, like herself, poor, or not so poor, they were
honest.  And really neighbours like these need to be
friendly.  If you are in the grip of grim poverty, and
sick and ill, you will find few more attentive to you,
and few whose attentions you will more readily suffer,
than those of neighbours who are just as poor as you.
</p>

<p>
Well-meaning ladies sometimes called upon the
Mackenzies with bundles of tracts and Pharisaical
advice, and out of politeness Mrs. Mackenzie suffered
them.  When, however, about a year and two months
after little Jack's adventure at the Morgans', his poor
mother fell sick, and was confined for weeks to bed,
it wasn't to her rich visitors in sealskin sacks and
gloves of kid she had to look for comfort and help.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, in expectation of just such an illness as
this, Mrs. Mackenzie had saved a little money.  But
there lived on the stair immediately below a
Mrs. Malony, whose husband was a blacksmith, who
sometimes, sad to say, took a dram.  He wasn't by any
means a bad fellow, however, and often took Johnnie
Greybreeks off with him for a whole day to the
smithy to see the sparks fly, and always shared his
dinner with Johnnie.  The blacksmith had no family,
and his wife used sometimes to go out charing, so her
hands were hard and rough.  But her heart wasn't.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony would often come up to borrow a flat-iron
or a "brander," or even a red herring for her
man's supper, when hard up.  On the other hand, if
she happened to make a good bargain down town on
a Saturday night, she would never forget to bring
"the shuestress" some portion of it&mdash;a piece of fish,
a few potatoes, a couple of sausages, or a bundle of
greens.  Often, too, in the long, dreary winter
forenights, Mrs. Malony would spend hours in her
neighbour's room.  She would at times bring her husband
also, when he was washed and tidied up; and he did
nothing but sit in a corner and smoke and smile.  But
Johnnie and his sister would "hurkle" down by the
fire, nursing the cat between them while they listened
to Mrs. Malony's wonderful tales of Ireland and the
down-trodden Irish.  Evenings like these passed
pleasantly enough away.
</p>

<p>
The children had a younger neighbour, though, a
pale-faced, roll-shouldered boy who lived in the
garret with his old mother, and used to play the fiddle
on the street to support her.  Very sweetly he did
play, too, though his airs were very sad.
</p>

<p>
Little Peter, as he was called, used to come downstairs
frequently to tea, and bring his fiddle.  Well,
the tea was almost an imaginary entertainment.  It
was a delightful sort of a make-belief.  To be sure,
there was bread and a scraping of butter, and thin,
thin tea, with but little milk and less sugar; but then
there were oyster-shells and round "chuckie-stanes"
to take the place of cakes and currant-buns and all
kinds of nice things.  And with Maggie presiding in
such a dignified and lady-like way, it was quite easy
for Little Peter to imagine that an oyster-shell was a
slice of delicious tea-cake, or a "chuckie-stane" a pasty.
</p>

<p>
Then there were really more laughing and fun at
these make-believe tea-parties than if everything had
been edible.
</p>

<p>
But that fiddle of Little Peter's was real.  There was
no mistake about the musical part of the entertainment.
But when poor Mrs. Mackenzie fell ill, the sealskin-sack
people came but seldom.  It might be something
catching, you know.  The young minister was kind,
however, though somewhat too solemn for a sick-room.
</p>

<p>
It would have been a sad and dreary time, then,
for the little family but for their kindly neighbours.
Poor Mrs. Malony, with her rough, red hand and her
plain face, became a sort of a saint.  She allowed
Malony to take his "pick" of dinner out of doors,
and made him always take Johnnie Greybreeks with
him, and keep him all day&mdash;there were no Board
schools in those days, you know.  Malony had also to
make his own cup of coffee when he returned at night,
buying a polony and a roll on the way to eat with it.
But Malony had his pipe, and took things very easy.
How gentle Mrs. Malony was with the poor invalid;
how softly she spread the bed and softened the hard,
small pillows!  Ah, it was indeed a treat to have
her there.  She was very plain-spoken, however.
Here, for example, was a specimen of the kind of
verbal comfort she used to give Mrs. Mackenzie:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"An' sure, Mrs. Mackenzee, ye needn't be throublin'
yourself aboot dyin' at all.  For whin ye're dead
and in the soilent grave, it's meself and Malony will
be lookin' after the childer.  Indade I'll bring thim
up as me own, and it's the beautiful blacksmith that
Johnnie will make; so niver be grievin', but die whin
ye plaze wid an aisy mind, an' sure it's the angels
will be waitin' for ye evermore."
</p>

<p>
Was it any wonder that as she listened to consolation
like this, and her mind reverted to her father's
beautiful home, or to her life with Donald in the
wee cottage by the banks of the bonnie Clyde, tears
stole down her pale cheeks?  But then she would
say to herself, "Oh, how ungrateful I am!" and so
she would seize and press Mrs. Malony's kindly hand,
and cry,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O dear Mrs. Malony, how good you are to me!
I'm sure I don't deserve it."
</p>

<p>
"Is it good ye're sayin', Mrs. Mackenzee?  Sure I
need all me goodness.  An' after all, isn't it the same
you'd be doin' for me if I was sick and ill?  There
now, don't cry.  Indade it's just as wake [weak] as
a baby ye are."
</p>

<p class="poem">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The young doctor was very attentive, but one
evening he left the bedside looking more thoughtful
than usual.  Mrs. Mackenzie seemed to be dozing, so
after keeping his fingers on her pale wrist for a
time, he had let the hand drop gently on the coverlet.
He looked at Mrs. Malony as he passed out, and she
followed him to the landing.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think," he said, "we can keep her."
</p>

<p>
"Och and och!" cried Mrs. Malony, with her rough
apron to her eyes.  "Och and och, dhoctor dear, is
it come to this?&mdash;so soon and sudden."
</p>

<p>
"I fear," he said, "she cannot last long."
</p>

<p>
"And is there no physic ye can think av at all, at
all, that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang physic!" cried the doctor.  "It isn't physic
she wants, Mrs. Malony, but good wine and beef-tea."
</p>

<p>
"An' would the tay and the wine take her from
the bhrink av the grave, dhoctor dear?"
</p>

<p>
"It would give her a chance.  Don't leave her, Mrs. Malony;
don't leave her!  I fear I can do little more."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony went back to the quiet room.  Her
patient seemed sleeping, and so she moved about like
a mouse, lest she should disturb her.
</p>

<p>
The spring sun was shining in through the window
and falling on a bunch of early flowers that Little
Peter had brought the invalid, because he knew she
loved them.  It fell also on the canary's cage.  Even
Dick had given up singing lately, as if he knew there
was sadness and grief in the air.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony drew the blind a little way down,
then left the room.  She stole downstairs on tiptoe.
Maggie was there, keeping house.
</p>

<p>
"Go up," said Mrs. Malony, "as quate as a weasel,
and sit by your mother till I come back."
</p>

<p>
Poor Maggie had been crying, but she now did as
she was told.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony went straight to her cupboard, now
her clothes-cupboard, and very soon made up a bundle.
</p>

<p>
"Och and och," she said to herself, "they won't
go far at all, at all."
</p>

<p>
They were the woman's Sunday clothes for all
that, and she meant to take them to the poor man's
banker at the sign of the three golden balls.
</p>

<p>
Then her eyes fell upon her stubby left hand.
</p>

<p>
"Set you up wid a gold ring indade, Mrs. Malony,"
she said, "when a brass one would do for a toime!
Ill-luck?  I won't belave it."
</p>

<p>
A tear fell on the ring nevertheless, for it brought
back memories of happy days of the half-forgotten
past.  No wonder then she sighed as she screwed
it off.
</p>

<p>
"You've been crying, Mrs. Malony," said the burly
pawnbroker as she laid the ring on the counter.
</p>

<p>
Then the tears sprang afresh to her eyes, and she
told him all the story.
</p>

<p>
"Put that ring back on your finger again this
moment, Mrs. Malony," said the man.  "I'm going
to let you have just double on the dresses.  Oh yes,
they're worth it.  I won't lose by it.  Now off you go
and buy the wine."
</p>

<p>
"Lord love you, Mr. Grant," said the poor woman
as she picked up the money.  "An' I belave it's
yourself that's saved a loife this blissid day."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Malony returned, she found Maggie
silently weeping by her mother's bed.  Then a great
fear got possession of her heart.  Had her sacrifice
been all in vain?  Was the invalid gone?  She
hastily deposited her purchases on the little table
and approached the bed.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie looked very still and beautiful.
She might have been made of wax, or her features
chiselled from purest marble.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony touched her hand that still lay on the
coverlet.  It was cold.  She bent over her, and could
hear no breathing.
</p>

<p>
Was as this indeed death?
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0104"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
"I'LL BE A SAILOR OR A SOLDIER."
</h3>

<p>
As she bent over the bed in grief and sorrow,
Mrs. Malony was rewarded and startled at the
same time.  For the poor patient heaved a sigh, and
slowly opened her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then a faint smile stole over her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I had such a happy dream!" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dear; don't spake another word."
</p>

<p>
It wasn't the first, nor the second patient either,
that Mrs. Malony had nursed, so she had all her wits
about her.
</p>

<p>
She knew that at this very moment Mrs. Mackenzie's
life was hanging by the merest thread, and there was
no time to lose.
</p>

<p>
She quickly squeezed some of the juice of the
meat into a saucer, and mixing it with a little wine,
put it tea-spoonful after tea-spoonful into her patient's
mouth.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie slept after this, a real not a dreamful
sleep, and towards evening she awoke refreshed.
A cupful of warm beef-tea was ready, and she smiled
her thanks as she sipped it.
</p>

<p>
All that night Mrs. Malony sat up and nursed her,
and when next day the doctor came, he was more
than satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"She will do now," he told Mrs. Malony on the
landing&mdash;"do for a time.  If she could only be got
down the Clyde to a cottage hospital I know
of&mdash;Well, I'll do what I can."
</p>

<p>
"Do, sorr; and may heaven be your portion evermore!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you how I think it can be managed,"
said Dr. Gregory, a few days after this.  "There is
a cottage hospital, or rather a home for poor
convalescents, down the water.  It is partly supported
by voluntary contributions, but the patients have to
pay a little themselves."
</p>

<p>
"But," interrupted Mrs. Malony, "the crayture
here is as poor as a church-mouse, sorr, and not able
to pay.  Och, and och!"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute, Mrs. Malony.  I have noticed
how deft and handy little Maggie here is.  She seems
really cut out for a nurse.  Now, at the home they
want just such a wee lass, and she would have food
and keep, and wages enough to maintain her mother
at the hospital.&mdash;Would you like to go, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Maggie, "I would be so delighted."
</p>

<p>
"All right then; I'll see about it at once."
</p>

<p>
And the doctor did see about it.  For a fortnight,
however, if not more, Mrs. Mackenzie was not strong
enough to be moved.  But during all this time she
was slowly improving.  This was perhaps as much
from the fact that she now had hope as from the
extra nourishment she received.
</p>

<p>
Little Johnnie Greybreeks, however, much to his
sorrow, was to remain in Glasgow, and live for a
time with the Malonies.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie kept up very bravely, though.  He wouldn't
have shed a tear before his mother or sister, not
even when the day of parting came, for anything.
But when in his little bed at night&mdash;ah! then I must
confess the lad did give way to grief.  We must
remember he was little more than a child after all.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to learn to be a big man," he told his
mother proudly on the last evening, "and Mr. Malony
says I'll soon be able to shoe a horse.  And, O
mother," he added, rather sadly, "shoeing horses is a
fine thing, but I would rather be a Highland soldier
and wear a feather bonnet, like what father wears in
his picture."
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy," replied his mother, "we must all try
to do our duty in the line of life God has appointed
us to."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony had a friend who was skipper of a
small sailing schooner.  Old Skipper Ross used to
pride himself in the beauty and sailing qualities of
his little craft, and had rebaptized her <i>Queen of the
Clyde</i>.
</p>

<p>
When this honest, red-faced seaman heard the story
of poor Mrs. Mackenzie, he took his pipe from his
mouth, and his face puckered with smiles under the
blue Kilmarnock night-cap he always wore.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mrs. Malony," he said, "instead of the puir
lady gaun doon the Clyde in a smoke-jack steam-boat,
I'll tak her mysel'.  Splinter my jib-boom if I
dinna."
</p>

<p>
This was very good of the skipper, and Mrs. Malony
gladly accepted the offer.
</p>

<p>
Malony himself got a day off.  They were all to
go down the Clyde together, and make a kind of
pleasure-trip of it.  They would even take Little
Peter with them, to give them music during the
voyage.
</p>

<p>
Well, it wasn't very often that a cab was seen to
draw up at 73 Summer Loaning, so when the jarvey
stopped and turned his horse at the "close mou',"*
young and old flocked out and lined the pavement.
When the poor wan invalid was got inside, many a
rough voice wished her God-speed, and they even
raised a cheer as the cab drove off and away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Mouth of the court.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a lovely spring morning when the <i>Queen of
the Clyde</i> caught the light breeze, and began manoeuvring
down the river, Skipper Ross himself holding
the tiller.  The old man declared he could steer his
ship through a hundred herring-boats and never run
foul of anything.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie and party had seats on the deck.
And everything was as clean and tidy, too, as the
duke's yacht itself, not a rope's end or belaying-pin
out of place, and the paint-work as bright as a gipsy's
caravan.
</p>

<p>
The invalid heaved a sigh of relief when at long
last the great noisy ship-building yards were left
behind, with the awful din of their ringing hammers,
and the bonnie river began to open out before them
broad and wide, with the sunshine glittering on its
bosom, and the greenery of trees and far-off hills
bounding the horizon.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie was thinking sadly of her dear
departed husband, who was buried at the lovely town of
Helensburgh, and Maggie and Jack were seated on
deck at her feet.  Then Peter drew out his fiddle.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! man, ay," cried the skipper.  "Play up, lad,
do.  Sweeter to me is the soond o' the fiddle and
its lang-drawn melody than the cry o' the sea-birds,
sailin' tack and half-tack roond ma wee bit shippie.
Play, laddie, play!"
</p>

<p>
So down the Clyde they dropped, floating as easily
as cormorant on the wave, past villages, past towns,
and wilds and woodlands green, and it was quite near
eventide when the <i>Queen</i> at last got alongside the
pier.
</p>

<p>
They had indeed enjoyed the voyage.  And Jack
had spread the banquet on the white planks of the
deck, and everybody enjoyed that also.
</p>

<p>
Just after it was done and cleared away, Skipper
Ross drew out a black bottle from a handy locker.
</p>

<p>
"Ye'll tak a wee skyte, Malony; winna ye?"
</p>

<p>
But Malony shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I've sworn off," he said.  "Indade, it's the truth
that I'm tellin' ye.  For this wee lad here has now to
look on Patrick Malony as his father.  But thank ye
all the same."
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
The parting was over, and Mrs. Mackenzie was
alone in a delightful little ward with her daughter
Maggie.  They had brought the canary, and he began
to sing the very next morning.  And no wonder; for
everything around was sweet and white and clean,
and honeysuckle waved its dark-green foliage around
the window, while afar off were the grand old purple
hills, with many a glen and wood between.
</p>

<p>
The cottage home was near to the sea too, for
flocks of gulls and rooks together could be seen out
in the fields yonder.
</p>

<p>
"You feel better to-day, mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dearie; I feel I shall get well now.  But,
child, I dread to think of the future."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is only because you are ill, you know.
God provides for the rooks and gulls yonder, mother,
and he won't forget us surely."
</p>

<p>
Maggie spoke cheerfully and sincerely.  She was
not one of your old-old-fashioned children, nor was
she given to preaching either.  The girl was tall and
ladylike, though very young, and pretty besides; but
she had a thoughtful and serious look in her eyes,
that showed she had not been reared in the stern
school of poverty and adversity in vain.
</p>

<p>
Maggie's faith was very simple.  Her little Bible
had for many a day been her friend and companion.
She went to it for consolation and guidance at all
times and under all circumstances, opening it at
random, and believing that the very first verse her
eyes fell upon was an answer to the thoughts that
filled her mind.
</p>

<p>
There really is much to be said for this simplicity
of faith, often present not only in the very young but
in their elders.  Science as yet is but groping in the
dark, although it seems inspired, and may be.  But
here, in this Book, we have all we appear to want for
our happiness laid down in a way that goes straight
to the heart.  It was concerning such simple wee
folks as Maggie, surely, that our Saviour spoke when
he said, "Suffer little children to come unto me: for
of such is the kingdom of heaven."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
When little Johnnie Greybreeks returned to Glasgow,
he found life for a time very dull indeed, though
the kind-hearted Mrs. Malony and her husband did
all they could to cheer him up.  But he used to lie
in his bed at night, awake and thinking, till long
past twelve.  What should he be?  That was the
question that puzzled him to answer.
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, Johnnie, as for the time being we
may continue to call him, was just a trifle ambitious.
At all events, working in the blacksmith's shop was
very monotonous, although he did all he could, and
really earned his food.  He didn't like it though,
and told himself so every night of his life, he
considering himself dreadfully ungrateful to the good
people with whom he lived for doing so.
</p>

<p>
Whenever Johnnie had an hour or so to spare,
Little Peter and he used to go wandering away down
by the Broomielaw to look at the ships.  Our young
hero was better clad now; for since good Tom Morgan
had given him that Sunday's suit, his former Sunday's
clothes became his week-day wear, and he looked by
no means a gutter-snipe or tatterdemalion.
</p>

<p>
Little Peter was as fond of ships as Johnnie, and
as he always took his fiddle with him, the Jackie-tars
used to invite him on board sometimes, to play to
them while they danced or sang.
</p>

<p>
"O Johnnie," said Peter one day, as they were going
back towards Summer Loaning, "if I wasna a miserable
little hunchback, I'd be a sailor mysel'."
</p>

<p>
Johnnie felt sorry for Peter, so to comfort him he
made answer,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, Peter, if I could play the fiddle as well as
you, I wouldn't care what my back was like.  Anyhow,
I've made up my mind either to be a sailor or a
soldier.  I'd like to wear a feather bonnet.&mdash;Hark!"
he continued.  "Peter, here come the Highlanders.
Can't you hear them?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, fine can I hear them.  The skirl o' the bagpipes
maks my bluid run dancin' through ilka vein in
my body, and if I had a sword and was big enough,
I could fight to music like that."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes after, the Highlanders came marching
and swinging along, their glittering bayonets
flashing in the evening sunshine high above their
nodding plumes.  Even Peter pulled himself an inch
taller as the two lads marched side by side with the
regiment all the way to the barracks.
</p>

<p>
Then they came sadly away.
</p>

<p>
"Which is it now?" said Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a soldier; but I'll have to wait till I grow."
</p>

<p>
"Unless you learn the drum, Johnnie Greybreeks,
Then you could go at once."
</p>

<p>
But Johnnie only shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Peter," he said; "I must be a real fighting
soldier, just as poor father was."
</p>

<p>
Little did Johnnie know that at that very time
there was a tidal wave advancing towards him that
might lead on to fortune.  Or on to death, who could
tell?  So true is it what Shakespeare says,&mdash;
</p>

CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
"HULLO, JOHNNIE GREYBREEKS!  I'M YOUR UNCLE."
</h3>

<p>
"Hullo, Johnnie Greybreeks!  Why, my little
man, I've been looking for you for the last
six months."
</p>

<p>
It was Tom Morgan himself the two friends had
run up against at the corner of Jamaica Street&mdash;big
Tom Morgan, brown waving beard and all.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you never come and see me?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, mother wouldn't let me.  You see, sir,
you were very good to me that Christmas eve, and
mother said if I went back it would look just
like&mdash;begging, you know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Fiddlesticks, Johnnie Greybreeks!  But talking
about fiddlesticks, who <i>is</i> your little friend here
carrying the fiddle?"
</p>

<p>
Johnnie told him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, come along, both of you," said Tom.  "I
know an eating-house near here where they have
such capital beef."
</p>

<p>
And a splendid feed Tom ordered them; and it
seemed to do the honest fellow's heart good to see
them eat.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Tom, "will you play me a tune, Peter? and
then I'll be off, for time is precious."
</p>

<p>
Peter gladly did as suggested; but I am sure that
big Tom Morgan merely asked him to play that he
might have an excuse for giving the poor lad that
half-crown.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Peter, you can run home; but I want to
take Johnnie Greybreeks with me for an hour or so.
Good-bye, Peter.  See you again.&mdash;Come on, Johnnie."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In about a quarter of an hour's time Tom Morgan
reached a tall, handsome building in a quiet street; and
upstairs the two went together, and entered a room
without knocking.  It was a well-furnished office, and
at a table, littered with papers and bundles of documents
tied up with red tape, sat a white-haired, elderly
gentleman, with a very pleasant face of his own.
</p>

<p>
When he looked up with a smile, Johnnie could see
it was Mr. Dawson, whom he had met on that Christmas
eve at the house of the Morgans.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Tom, and take a seat.  Ha! so you've
found little Johnnie Greybreeks at last, have you?&mdash;How
do you do, my little man?&mdash;I say, Tom, how is
business?"
</p>

<p>
"Fairly good."
</p>

<p>
"Well, lad, let me tell you this: it will soon be
better, or it will get a send back that will astonish
us all."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Dawson.  There
must always be ships on the sea, and it is father's
business to float them."
</p>

<p>
"True, true, Tom; but being a lawyer, you know,
I perhaps can see farther off than you.  Now, believe
me, Tom Morgan, when I tell you we are drifting
into war with Russia, and our country isn't prepared
for it."
</p>

<p>
Tom Morgan laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We've got the money and the ships, the sailors
and the soldiers.  Why, Mr. Dawson, let war come, and
we'll flog the Russians on shore, and whip them off
the seas."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not so sure; but then I'm getting old,
you know.  But you'll see.  The Russian privateers
and legalized pirates will cover the ocean, and British
commerce won't have a show."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see that noble Highland regiment march
past, Mr. Dawson?  Man, that's the stuff!&mdash;Did you
see them, Johnnie?"
</p>

<p>
"O yes, sir; me and Peter marched all the way
with them.  O sir, I want to be a soldier or a sailor,
and help to whip the Russians.  Dear father was a
soldier, you know," he added sadly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawson and Tom Morgan exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us more about your father, Johnnie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know much.  I hardly remember
father; but poor mother has his picture, and, O sir,
he looks so noble, with his kilt and his sword and
his feather bonnet.  He only had one arm, you know,
and&mdash;and he was drowned in the Clyde."
</p>

<p>
"Now tell us about your mother and sister.  Where
are they, and what do they do?"
</p>

<p>
Then Johnnie told all the sad story of sickness, of
struggle, and of poverty that the reader already
knows.  More than once the tears stole into his eyes
as he spoke, and very patiently indeed did the two
gentlemen listen to all he said.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," said Mr. Dawson, when Johnnie had finished,
"I think we're on the right lay."
</p>

<p>
"I think so too; indeed, I'm sure of it."
</p>

<p>
"How pleased the old lady will be:'
</p>

<p>
"If there is any 'please' in her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she has some strange ways with her; but I
think that she really means well."
</p>

<p>
"She is extremely orthodox, Mr. Dawson."
</p>

<p>
"True; and conservative to a degree."
</p>

<p>
All this was Greek to little Johnnie Greybreeks,
who sat there on a high stool waggling his legs, and
looking from one to the other, uncertain whether he
ought to smile or not.  Ever feel in that position,
reader?  I have.
</p>

<p>
"Weren't you struck with the remarkable resemblance
between Johnnie here and your brother's wee
lassie, on the night you brought the boy home?"
</p>

<p>
"That, indeed, I was," said Tom Morgan; "and so
was every one else, especially my father.  So, you
see," continued Tom, figuring the sentence out on his
fingers, "if my oldest brother married Johnnie's
father's eldest and only sister&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That sounds rather Irish, Tom," interrupted
Mr. Dawson; "but go on, my boy.  Johnnie's father's
eldest and only sister&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I never was good at counting kin, as it is
called, but my brother Fred did marry Johnnie's
father's sister&mdash;all the world knows that: so little
Tottie&mdash;Violet, you know&mdash;is Johnnie's cousin&mdash;no
wonder she is like him; and my brother Fred's wife
would be Johnnie's aunt; and&mdash;and&mdash;why, Dawson,
I myself am Johnnie's uncle.&mdash;Hullo, Johnnie
Greybreeks!  I'm your uncle.  I'm your uncle Tom; shake
hands, old man."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Johnnie really could not have
affirmed whether his head or his heels were uppermost,
or whether this big, jolly gentleman with the
big brown beard wasn't having a joke at his
expense.  However, he shook hands almost mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" cried Tom; "there are little footsteps on
the stairs, and the sound of childish laughter.  I
believe it is Violet and her governess.  Talk of angels,
and they appear."
</p>

<p>
Next moment in rushed Violet, screaming with
delight.  She kissed Uncle Tom somewhere about the
beard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, "doverness has been so dood, and
buyed me such a lot of pletty fings."
</p>

<p>
Then she noticed Johnnie.
</p>

<p>
She stuck one finger in her mouth thoughtfully,
but recovering her self-possession almost immediately,
she advanced and held out her wee chubby hand.
</p>

<p>
"I fink," she said, "you is Dohnnie Dleybleeks?
How d'ye do, little boy?  You and me has met
before."
</p>

<p>
Johnnie jumped off the stool and shook hands as
politely as a nobleman would have done.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they like now!" said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Gibb," he continued, addressing the governess,
"we&mdash;that is, Mr. Dawson chiefly&mdash;have made
a wonderful discovery.  This boy you see before
you, and who is called Jack Mackenzie, is my niece&mdash;no,
I mean nephew&mdash;by the brother's side, as it
were, and consequently first cousin-german to&mdash;I say,
Mr. Dawson, bother it all, I'm getting a bit mixed
again."
</p>

<p>
Miss Gibb laughed.
</p>

<p>
"So you's my fist tousin, 'ittle boy, is you?&mdash;Miss
Dibb, tiss my fist tousin for me; I can't be boddled
tissing 'ittle boys."
</p>

<p>
Miss Gibb dutifully did as she was told; at which
condescension Johnnie was more puzzled than ever.
He would have given three of his best marbles at
that moment to any one who could have told him
where he was in particular, and what day of the week
it was.
</p>

<p>
But the interview was soon brought to an end;
and when Johnnie went back to his home in Summer
Loaning, a very droll story indeed he had to tell
Mrs. Malony.
</p>

<p>
"Och, sure," she cried, "I always tould Malony that
poor dear Mrs. Mackenzie wasn't the same as us at
all, at all; that she was a lady under a cloud, sure
enough.  And troth and I'm roight.  And it's a foine
gintleman you'll be, Johnnie, some day entoirely."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Old Mrs. Mackenzie of Drumglen in Perthshire was
certainly all that Tom and Mr. Dawson had said.
She was nothing if not orthodox and conservative to
a degree.
</p>

<p>
She belonged to a very old and aristocratic family
in the north of Inverness-shire.  The family,
however, had the misfortune to be somewhat poor, and
ill-natured people did say that when Miss Stuart
married Mr. Mackenzie, a Jamaica merchant, it was
more from love of money and what it could bring than
from love of Mac himself.  But, of course, ill-natured
people will say anything, and charity is a flower that
is not half so well cultivated as it ought to be.
</p>

<p>
Never mind.  Miss Stuart was at the time of
her wedding stately, tall, and handsome, and&mdash;a
stanch Jacobite.  Mr. Mackenzie, on the other hand,
was on the weather-side of forty, and though wiry
enough, he was about the same colour as a cake of
gingerbread.  That is what Jamaica and the West
Indies had done for him.
</p>

<p>
He took his bride out with him at first to the
beautiful islands of the West.  She admitted they
were very beautiful, but she didn't like life there, and
she went in a constant state of fear and horror of the
creepie-creepies.  The flowers were gorgeous, but
often from the very centre of a lovely bouquet brought
by her black maid a centiped as long as a penholder
would wriggle.  In the centre of huge bunches of
luscious fruit little wicked snakes would be asleep,
and even as she stood admiring the fruit, one would
protrude a tiny triangle of a head and venomously
hiss in her face.  Oh, it wasn't nice.
</p>

<p>
Fire-flies were pretty flitting about among the
bushes at night, like stars that had lost their way;
but she found creatures indoors even in her bedroom
that were not fire-flies, and whose perfume
was not like that of attar of roses.  She even found
things in the soup that the <i>chef</i> couldn't account for,
and cockroaches' legs are not the thing in a cup of
coffee.
</p>

<p>
So she told Mackenzie, gently but firmly, that she
was going home; that she would not give one glimpse
of the purple heather for all the beauty and wealth of
the Indian Isles.
</p>

<p>
Mac was very fond of his aristocratic bride.  If
she had asked him to live in Kamschatka or build
her a mansion in lonely Spitzbergen, he would have
done so.  Therefore, like a dutiful husband, he came
home.
</p>

<p>
He brought with him a black servant-man, or boy
who eventually became a man, just to remind him of
those sunny isles in the beautiful West; and soon after
his return he bought the mansion-house and broad
lands of bonnie Drumglen.
</p>

<p>
Not long after Johnnie's father was born, Mr. Mackenzie
died one wild, stormy winter's morning.  After
being so long in the tropics, I suppose, the climate of
the Scottish Highlands hardly suited him.  He was
found asleep in his library chair, with his hands folded,
his toes on the fender, and a red bandana laid as usual
over the bald patch on his crown.
</p>

<p>
His black servant shook him&mdash;once, twice, thrice.
It was the laird's last sleep, and shaking was
unavailing.
</p>

<p>
So Snowball went and reported the circumstance
to his mistress.
</p>

<p>
"Pore massa done gone dead, I fink, milady.  I
shakee he, one, two, tree time, but he not sware at
me.  I fink, milady, he nebber wake no mo' in dis
world."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was somewhat strange that Mrs. Mackenzie never
seemed to take to her daughter, who was about five
years older than Donald her boy&mdash;Johnnie's father.
Her whole life and love seemed bound up in her son.
</p>

<p>
Under the plea of giving her the best education it
was possible to obtain, the girl was sent to a school
in Edinburgh.  There she lived and grew up, only
coming home at holiday-time.
</p>

<p>
It was at Edinburgh, too, that Flora met Fred
Morgan, the son of the wealthy ship-broker.  Flora,
of course, asked her mother's consent to marry
Fred&mdash;meaning to marry him, anyhow, for the Mackenzies
had always been a self-willed race.
</p>

<p>
The letter bearing the mother's reply came in due
course.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly, my dear."
</p>

<p>
That was the gist of it when shorn of its studied
and stately verbiage.
</p>

<p>
At the same time that Sambo, <i>alias</i> Snowball,
posted this letter, he dropped one into the box for
Mr. Dawson, the family solicitor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawson went through at once to Drumglen.
He arrived early in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
But "milady" was as politely reticent as a Mohawk
Indian.  She said nothing about business that day.
</p>

<p>
He dined in state&mdash;with Snowball behind his high-backed
chair, arrayed in a crimson waistcoat and
immaculate coat and neckerchief.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Mrs. Mackenzie accorded her solicitor
an interview within the gloomy precincts of the
library.  The lady came to the point at once, and
with as much force and precision as Malony made
use of when beating a red-hot horse-shoe.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter is going to be married, Mr. Dawson,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
Dawson bowed and smiled.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Mackenzie brought him up with a round
turn.
</p>

<p>
"No palaver, Mr. Dawson, please," she jerked out.
"My daughter is going to be married.  She did me
the courtesy of asking my leave&mdash;a mere matter of
friendly formality, of course.  She is going to marry
a Morgan.  The Morgans are Welsh.  I don't like
the Welsh; they are mere business people.  I don't
like that.  I believe a daughter of mine might have
married a lord.  <i>N'importe</i>; it is no fault of mine.
But, Mr. Dawson, these Morgans are said to be
wealthy Welsh.  Well, my estate is my own, is it
not?"
</p>

<p>
"To have and to hold, my dear lady; to do absolutely
what you please with."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Dawson, I can leave all to my dear boy
if he continues to love and obey his mother as he
does now; but I come of a very independent family,
and, if I choose, I can leave my riches to build an
hospital, or, what is even more needed, a new ship
of war.  Now, sir, make out a cheque for £5,000 to
my daughter, and I will sign it.  Write also a letter,
couched in friendly but not too friendly terms, to
accompany this cheque.  I want my daughter, or rather
the Morgans, to understand that there is a gulf fixed
between the mansion-house of Drumglen and their
shop in Glasgow."
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Dawson had obeyed her orders to the
very letter.
</p>

<p>
He had, however, always since then managed to
keep on the very best terms with the Morgans, as
well as with Mrs. Mackenzie herself.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Long, long years, as we know, had gone by since
that day when Mrs. Mackenzie turned her soldier son
out to face the wide world and poverty, and the stern
old dame had somewhat softened as she grew older.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps if Donald had gone to Drumglen and
begged her forgiveness, she would have relented and
received him into favour once more.  But the same
proud blood ran in the veins of both mother and son.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dawson went very often to Drumglen, and
sometimes spent weeks fishing or shooting on the
estate.  He enjoyed this, although the house itself
and the company were hardly free and easy enough
to suit the jolly solicitor.
</p>

<p>
Dawson was summoned rather hastily once.  This
was after the body of poor Lieutenant Donald
Mackenzie, her son, had been found in the river.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor found her looking older than ever he
had seen her.  She seemed broken, not as to physique,
but mentally.
</p>

<p>
She talked a deal about her younger days and her
married life, and Dawson guessed rightly that she was
working the subject round to her late son.
</p>

<p>
"O Mr. Dawson," she said at last, "I don't mind
confessing to you that I have been just a little too
hasty, and that if poor Donald were alive again I&mdash;I
might consider the whole subject.  But there,
Mr. Dawson, my regrets are vain; and now I wish you to
make my will, for I feel I must soon follow my
husband to the grave."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mrs. Mackenzie, you are not at all old yet,
However," he added, "it is as well we should all be
prepared."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and that was just what good Mr. M'Thump,
our minister, said in the pulpit yesterday.  His text
was, 'For ye know not the day nor the hour.'  A
good man and a learned is Mr. M'Thump, and he'll
dine with you to-night, Mr. Dawson."
</p>

<p>
I fear the solicitor did not look overmuch pleased
at the information.  However, he proceeded to take
pencil notes of the lady's will, and that very evening
he drew it up.
</p>

<p>
It was brief in the extreme.  She left all she
possessed to build a new ship of war, to assist in
protecting the freedom of her beloved country.*
</p>

<p>
Years flew by.  The old dame appeared to have
renewed her age, as she certainly had her sternness
and aristocratic composure.  She never mentioned her
son now; but Dawson took good care to tell her all
about the discovery of little Johnnie Greybreeks, and
how strangely he had turned up at the Christmas
party.  He told the story so feelingly that more than
once during the recital he fancied he saw a tear in
the stately lady's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Half a year after this Dawson was once more summoned
to Drumglen.
</p>

<p>
"I had a strange dream last night," she told him.
"I thought I saw Donald my boy.  He held his little
son by the hand, and looked at me, oh, so pleadingly.
Heigh-ho!  I suppose I am old and soft and silly;
but, Mr. Dawson, I am not sure I should not like to
see that boy Jack you spoke about&mdash;just for once, if
you can find him."
</p>

<p>
"I will do my best, madam," said Dawson.
</p>

<p>
Dawson, however, was not much of a detective, else
he might have found Johnnie before that day on
which Tom Morgan met him accidentally near the
bridge.
</p>

<p>
And now we shall see what this accidental meeting
led to as far as Johnnie was concerned.

CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
"THE OLD LADY HAD A WOMAN'S HEART AFTER ALL."
</h3>

<p>
"<i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>" (I came, I saw, I conquered).
</p>

<p>
So said Cæsar of old, by way of describing
the ease with which he gained a victory against his
enemies.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Veni, vidi, vici,</i>" Johnnie Greybreeks might
have said, after his first interview with that stately
and aristocratic dame his grandmother.
</p>

<p>
But wait a minute, reader.  I fear I must call our
little hero Johnnie Greybreeks no longer&mdash;at least not
while he is under the lordly roof-tree of Drumglen.
He must be Jack.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was Dawson himself who brought Johnnie&mdash;no,
I mean Jack&mdash;to the mansion-house, and led
him into the presence of his grandma.
</p>

<p>
Johnnie&mdash;that is Jack; you see I can't get into the
swing of it all at once&mdash;was very neatly dressed in
Highland tweeds, and brave he looked.  The old lady
sat erect in her high-backed chair.  She could not
but notice the striking resemblance between the boy
and her Donald of the olden days; yet she had meant
to receive him most soberly and stately.
</p>

<p>
"This is Jack," said Dawson, leading the boy, who
was looking shy, forward.
</p>

<p>
The grandam drew herself up.  She looked at
Jack once.  She looked at him twice.  Then she
opened wide her arms; and as Jack flew like a bird
to her embrace, she pressed him to her heart and
fairly burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Even Dawson was affected, and wisely withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Old Mrs. Mackenzie had a woman's heart then,
after all.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
What a long, delightful letter that was Jack wrote
to his mother and sister next day!  It did both their
hearts good.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie, junior, was glad, for her boy's sake,
that he had found a friend that would advance him
in life.  For her own part, she would have died at
the foot of a pine tree rather than accept a favour
from the proud owner of Drumglen, albeit she was
her late husband's mother.
</p>

<p>
Ah! pride, and especially Scotch pride, is a bitter
feeling, and often even a cruel.  Pride has been called
the devil's darling sin, and by Pope
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The never-failing vice of fools."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Says Goldsmith,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,<br />
  I see the lords of humankind pass by."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Well, I do believe that with Grandam Mackenzie
the stream of life now began to run backwards for a
time.  She had invited Jack to stay but for a week
or two; but the sweet summer-time was coming on,
and the boy required no second invitation to make
Drumglen his home for a time.  The words "for a
time" are Mrs. Mackenzie's own, and perhaps she
hardly knew the full meaning of them herself.
</p>

<p>
Jack wasn't going to forget old friends, however,
and he wrote to Mrs. Malony, and to Little Peter also,
and promised to write again.
</p>

<p>
I think that young Jack had not been at Drumglen
for even a week before the rigidity of the mansion
began to thaw.
</p>

<p>
Jack was jolly, but never with a jollity approaching
to vulgarity.  Indeed, in company and at table, thanks
to his mother's tuition, the boy behaved himself like
a little lord.  But he often said droll things that
made everybody laugh, and caused even the orthodox
Mr. M'Thump to smile.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, the ladies and gentlemen who assembled
at a dinner-party here were as stiff and straight in
the back, physically and morally, as the chairs in
which they sat.
</p>

<p>
When the ladies retired, however, the men folks
did unbend, and some of them drew Jack out; and
Jack&mdash;he did not require a very great deal of
encouragement&mdash;gave his ideas about life and things in
general in such a comically philosophical way, that
old-fashioned lairds thumped the table and laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
There was just one subject, however, on which Jack
was wisely silent&mdash;namely, his sad life of poverty and
distress in stony-hearted Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
Some things are better left unsaid, some stories
better left untold.  And Jack knew this instinctively
as it were, and held his peace&mdash;for his
grandma's sake.
</p>

<p>
Moreover he kept his own counsel concerning the
whereabouts of his mother and sister, even when so
eminent and dignified an individual as the
Rev. Mr. M'Thump endeavoured to draw him out.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-078"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-078.jpg" alt="&quot;This is Jack.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;This is Jack.&quot;
</p>

<p>
In this, again, Jack pleased his grandma very much.
Drumglen mansion-house was in itself a somewhat
antiquated and dreary abode, although situated in the
midst of the most beautiful Highland scenery&mdash;hill
and dale, river, loch, scaur, and wild wood.
</p>

<p>
The weeping birch trees were nowhere of sweeter,
softer green in early spring than on the banks and
braes around here; and among their branches the
mavis and blackbirds trilled their songs with a joy
that seemed half hysterical, while from far aloft,
skimming the clouds, the laverock showered his notes
of love.  Nowhere did the primroses grow bigger,
cooler, sweeter, than by the banks of the bickering
burn that went singing over the stones on its way to
the loch, forming many a clear pool wherein the
minnows darted hither and thither, and where the
crimson-ticked trout loved to bask in the sunshine.  Then in
autumn the hills around were purpled and encrimsoned
with heather and heath high up their sides, till
their rugged heads were lost in the clouds.
</p>

<p>
But the garden walls of Drumglen were high and
strong, and the gates of ponderous iron.  It seemed
as if they had been built to stand a siege in the
stormy days of old.
</p>

<p>
Inside these walls the garden itself was wide and
wild, and away aloft, in the black and gloomy foliage
of the pine trees, the hoody crow had his nest, and
eke that bird of ill-omen the magpie.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the house itself were very thick and
the windows small.  Not a sound did your footsteps
make as you glided about the rooms.  So silent did you
move on the thick, soft carpets, that you could scarce
help thinking at times that you were your own ghost.
</p>

<p>
The furniture of this gloomy house seemed a thousand
years old at least.  The stairs were of oak; and
when Jack first beheld his grandmother's bed, he
gazed at it with a feeling of awe.  It was a huge,
dark, and curtained edifice, with drapery of the
snowiest white.  To have slept under such a weight
as that would have made a stranger dream he was
about to be smothered alive.
</p>

<p>
The old dame's servants had always been chosen
for their solemnity, one would have said, and their
reverential stateliness.  They had never been heard
to laugh till Jack went to reside at the mansion.
</p>

<p>
But now things were a little bit altered.  For the
boy moved about the house like a ray of sunshine,
and you could no more have kept him from laughing,
or singing the fag-ends of old Scotch songs, than you
could have prevented a lark from trilling his
love-lilts in May.
</p>

<p>
I may tell you that Jack knew well enough that
his grandam wished him to keep his place if ever
he entered the servants' hall.  So he did; and yet
his presence there never failed to bring sunshine,
light, and music, and oftentimes now the dark oak
ceilings re-echoed the mirth of servants who had ever
before been as sad and solemn as church beadles or
funeral mutes.
</p>

<p>
With all her orthodox conservativeness, however,
Mrs. Mackenzie seemed to know that boys like Jack
cannot live without amusement, and so at no time
was she averse to the visits of youngsters of his own
age.  She even gave entertainments, and invited to
them the children of neighbouring lairds, so that on
the whole Jack's life was not so solemn an affair as
it might otherwise have been.
</p>

<p>
In the evenings when alone together, the old lady
used to make him draw his low stool up close beside
her knee and talk to her.  She would even encourage
him to tell her about life in what might well be called
the lower regions of the great city of Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
The disinterested kindness of Mrs. Malony and poor
Little Peter, the hunch-backed fiddler boy, visibly
affected Jack's grandmother.
</p>

<p>
"I did not think," she said, "that the poor could
be so kind to each other as that.  I will send
Mrs. Malony, and Peter too, a Christmas-box when the
time comes round.  And so they were going to make
a blacksmith of my brave boy, were they?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandma; but I love work."
</p>

<p>
"How terrible!"
</p>

<p>
Jack bent down to smooth an old grimalkin that
snoozed upon the rug.
</p>

<p>
"Malony wasn't so very terrible, though," he said;
"and I suppose, grandma, if nobody was a smithy-John,
nobody's horses would have any shoes to wear."
</p>

<p>
"True, my dear, quite true.  As the potter makes
his wares, some to honour and some to dishonour, so
are we too made, and we should do our duty in the
station of life which God has appointed us to fill."
</p>

<p>
Jack didn't reply.  He was gazing into the bright
fire of peats and coal that blazed so cheerfully on the
low hearth, and wondering what station in life it
would be his to fill.
</p>

<p>
"Jack," she said, after a pause, "did it ever occur
to you that you would like to be something?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked up at her now with glowing, happy
face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, indeed, grandma!"
</p>

<p>
"And what have you thought of?&mdash;the church?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, grandma."
</p>

<p>
"But think of the honour and glory of serving
Him even in this world, and the richness of the
reward hereafter.  Think of our minister, the
Rev. Titus M'Thump.  He has ere now been honoured by
dining even with royalty."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I'm not good enough," said Jack simply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, child, the law affords facilities for rising
to eminence in the world.  Mr. Dawson, my own
solicitor, is both a great and a good man.  But," she
added, as Jack did not reply, "how would you like
to be a leech?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked up astonished, with eyes about as big
as billiard-balls.  He had seen Malony apply a leech
once to his sister's neck when she was ill of quinsy,
and did not know that "leech" was the old name for
physician.
</p>

<p>
"A leech, grandma! a nasty, black, creepie-crawlie,
blood-sucking leech!  Oh no, grandma.  You are
making fun, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the old dame gravely, "you are quite
right.  I don't care for the profession myself.  Your
strictures on the leech are probably somewhat severe,
however.  I had one to dine with me a few months
back, and really he seemed fairly intelligent."
</p>

<p>
"Dine with a leech!" thought Jack; "why, grandmother
must be going out of her mind."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack, what would you like to be?"
</p>

<p>
"I would like, grandma, to be a Highland soldier,
and wear a feather bonnet."
</p>

<p>
Grandma smiled sadly, and for a time gazed silently
at the fire.
</p>

<p>
"No, Jack, no.  I would not like you to be a
soldier.  Anything else?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," replied the boy, eagerly enough.  "You
see, grandma, Mr. Dawson says there is going to be a
big, big war with Russia."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so, dear, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sailors fight as well as soldiers, and dress all
in blue and gold, for I've seen some.  They don't
have feather bonnets, though&mdash;only just cocked hats
and long swords.  Well, I would like to be a sailor
like that; and I'm sure when I grow bigger I could
cut off an enemy's head beautifully."
</p>

<p>
"O boy, boy, how horrible!  Well, I'll think
about it; and if your mother will let you stay with
me for a time, I will get you a good and clever tutor."
</p>

<p>
Jack did not answer, but he took his grandma's
soft hand in both his, and leaned his cheek upon it in
a gently caressing way.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," thought old Mrs. Mackenzie; "that is
the way poor Donald used to caress my hand when he
was quite a boy.  Surely the Lord has given me this
child's love to cheer my old age, and to prove that
he has forgiven me."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Dawson and Mrs. Mackenzie the elder had a consultation
soon after this.  The subject to be considered
was this: How best could she do something for her
daughter-in-law that would not wound her pride?
</p>

<p>
"I felt sure," said the solicitor, with straightforwardness,
"that you would put this question to me,
and I have thought it well out.  The doctor has told
me that she is now almost well, but that if she returns
to her life of poverty and hard work in Glasgow, she
will soon find her last home in the mools."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Dawson?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear madam, the cottage hospital down
the Clyde is turning a great success; if you could
add two beds to it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing would please me better.  I will build a
small additional wing to it, with a little cottage and
garden near for the matron."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks.  You quite anticipate what I was
going to say."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;that my daughter-in-law could be appointed
manageress, with Jack's sister as nurse."
</p>

<p>
"That is it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is as good as accomplished.  Only let it
be between ourselves.  No one is to know who the
donor is."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed."
</p>

<p>
"It is to be our little secret, Mr. Dawson; and,
after all, I think one may just as well do good with
one's money while alive as after death."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly is more satisfactory.  How about the
man-o'-war ship, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is another subject I hope to discuss with
you one day.  Perhaps&mdash;but&mdash;well, the matter needs
further consideration, so for the present we shall
dismiss it."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Jack stayed all the summer at Drumglen; but
when the autumn came round, his grandmother, one
evening as they sat by the fire, opened the
conversation by saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy, your tutor, Mr. Newington, tells me
you have been working very hard, and made capital
progress in your studies; so I am going to send you
home for six whole weeks to your mother and sister,
at the Cottage Hospital.  I hear there has been a new
wing built to it, and a little house and garden for the
matron, and that your mother has been appointed to
that position.  Well, dear boy, write and tell them
you are coming; and I'll give you an envelope with
something in it, so that you can pay your way, and
be quite the little gentleman."
</p>

<p>
Jack took her hand in the old caressing way; but
he did even more&mdash;he drew her arm right round his
neck and nestled more closely up to her knee.
</p>

<p>
"Dear grandma," he said, "you are so good to me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Malony was busy making her husband's supper
one evening about a week after this, when the
door opened, and in bounced Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Och, sure," she cried, "and is it me own dear bhoy,
Johnnie Greybreeks?  Indade and indade it was only
this blissed morning I was talking to Phatrick about
ye.  An' how well you are looking, alanna! troth it's
the foine young gintleman ye are already entoirely.
See there, the very cat knows ye; and won't Peter
be plazed!"
</p>

<p>
And so she rattled on.  By-and-by the husband
himself came in, smiling all over his black and smutty
face, and right heartily Johnnie shook his hard and
brooky fist.
</p>

<p>
After supper Peter came down, and brought the
fiddle too.  That was one of the happiest nights
ever Johnnie remembered spending.
</p>

<p>
Next day he went to see Mr. Dawson and the
Morgans, but only for a hurried visit.  Then the
steamer <i>Iona</i> took him down stream, and at sunset he
was seated beside his mother's cottage fire, with the
dearest ones on earth beside him&mdash;one on each side.
</p>

<p>
How cosy and home-like everything looked around
him! even the canary and the cat seemed as if they
had been specially ordained for the cheerful room.
There were flowers, too, everywhere, inside and out;
but Maggie Mackenzie was the sweetest flower of
all&mdash;so even her brother Jack thought.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed primly, it is true, as became her
position as a nurse, but that did not detract in the
slightest degree from her lady-like appearance.
</p>

<p>
Jack's mother, too, was looking well.
</p>

<p>
"Strange how things come about, dear boy," she
said.  "You see the Lord heard our prayers, and has
raised us up friends.  For ever blessed be his name!"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke she wiped away a tear with her white
apron.  It was a tear of joy and gratitude, however.
</p>

<p>
For this evening Jack's mother felt that her heart
was full to overflowing.
</p>

<p><a id="chap0107"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
"HARD A-PORT!"
</h3>

<p>
"Eep&mdash;peep&mdash;peep&mdash;eep&mdash;eep&mdash;ee!"
</p>

<p>
It was the bos'n's pipe sounding loud and
shrill high over the howling of a nor'-wester and the
song of the storm-stirred waves.
</p>

<p>
"Eep&mdash;peep&mdash;eep&mdash;ee!"
</p>

<p>
First forward, then further aft amidships.
</p>

<p>
"All hands shorten sail!"
</p>

<p>
"Tumble up, my lads&mdash;tumble up; it's going to
blow a buster."
</p>

<p>
And hardly had the last notes of the pipe ceased
as quickly as if they had been cut off clear and sharp
by the wind, than the men came rattling up the
ladders to duty.
</p>

<p>
There was every need for haste too, for the storm
had suddenly increased to almost the force of a tornado.
The sun was sinking red and angrily away in the
west-sou'-west, his last rays luridly lighting up the foam
and spume of each breaking billow, and casting rusty
rays even on the spray that was now dashing inboard
high as the top of the funnel itself.  There was no
steam up, however, nor were there even banked fires,
albeit the ship was not very far off land.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i>&mdash;for that was her name&mdash;was a screw
gunboat of the very largest build then on the list,
with six good Armstrongs on her deck, besides a
monster pivot-gun forward.
</p>

<p>
She was a model.  I don't say that because, many
a long year after the date of my story, I myself sailed
in her.  But a model of beauty the <i>Gurnet</i> was, as
good as ever sailor would care to look upon.  Low in
the water, with none too much freeboard, perhaps;
rakish as to masts; bows like a clipper, without any
merchant-service flimsiness about them though; and
jib-boom like part of a picture.  Solid and strong
was she though, and as black all over as the wing of
a rook, except where, just on the edges, her ports were
picked out with vermilion.
</p>

<p>
"All hands shorten sail!"
</p>

<p>
Yes; and it is indeed time, with the wind howthering
like that, tearing at the sails with angry jerks,
and trying the strength of the sturdy ship from stem
to stern, from bowsprit to rattling rudder-chains.
</p>

<p>
And she on a lee-shore!
</p>

<p>
Yes: the <i>Gurnet</i> had crossed the Bay of Biscay on
the wings of a beautiful wind a trifle abaft the beam.
She had passed the Gulf of Corunna, and was now
just off Cape Finisterre, or Land's End as we would
call it; but nobody, two hours ago, could have
believed that the wind would pop round a point or two
and come on to blow like this.
</p>

<p>
"Where in a' the warld are you goin' to, laddie?"
</p>

<p>
It was the doctor who spoke&mdash;Dr. Reikie, assistant-surgeon
in charge&mdash;and as he sang out these words
he caught young Midshipman Mackenzie by the lower
part of his uniform, as he was struggling up the
companion-ladder.
</p>

<p>
The clutch that he made at him was a very
unceremonious one indeed, but a most effectual, for he
hauled the middie right back and down into the
steerage.
</p>

<p>
"Where were you off to, eh?  Are you going daft?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, it's all hands on deck, isn't it?" said
Jack Mackenzie, for it was he.  "Mustn't I keep my
watch, and help to reef topsails?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie laughed loud enough to be heard high
above the trampling of feet and shouting of orders
on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!  Well, I declare, that's about the
best thing I've heard for many a day.  Man," he
added, leading Jack straight off into the cosy little
ward-room, "what use d'ye think a vision of a thing
like you would be on deck?  No more use, man, than
a cat in front of a carriage and four.  Sit down on
the locker there, or, what is better still, lie down, and
thank your stars you've gotten a countryman o' your
ain to look after you."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jack, mournfully, "I suppose I must
do as I'm told."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care you do, youngster.  You may
disobey anybody else in the mess, but if you dinna do
as I tell you, man, I'll lay you across the table and
lunner the riggin' o' you.  But there," he added, more
kindly, "I'm only in fun, or half in fun, you know.
Only, dinna forget I'm senior in this mess, and sit
at the head o' the table.  If I hadn't hauled you
down the companion, you'd have been washed
half-way to Finisterre afore now."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, mind you're a kind of in the sick-list, and
never a watch do you keep&mdash;except that bonnie gowd
one in your pocket that your granny gave you&mdash;till
I give you leave."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Jack again.  "But what is
supposed to be the matter with me?"
</p>

<p>
"A touch of sea-sickness&mdash;your gills are as white
as a haddock's.&mdash;Inexperience, and the want o'
sea-legs.&mdash;Hark! listen!  We've carried away something."
</p>

<p>
This was indeed true; although reefed, the
maintopsail had gone.
</p>

<p>
I could not say how many ribbons it was rent into,
but the noise those ribbons made was indescribable.
It was like the rattling of platoon-firing when a
regiment of soldiers is being drilled.
</p>

<p>
"I told the skipper the glass was going down like
tea and scandal, and he only laughed at me.  If a
man refuses to obey the dictates of science, well,
he deserves to lose his ship&mdash;that's all I've got to
say."
</p>

<p>
"You don't think we're going to be shipwrecked,
do you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Laddie, how can I tell?  If the wind changes,
and we don't get up steam in time, our ribs may be
dang in on the rocks before mornin'.  But don't be
afraid.  I daresay it will all come right.  I'm going
on deck to see how her neb is pointing.  Keep quiet,
and think about your mammy."
</p>

<p>
And away the doctor went, steadying himself by
bulkheads or anything he could lay hold on.
</p>

<p>
It was now getting very dusk indeed, but so
quickly had the men aloft done their duty, that the
ship was already snug, and all hands had come below.
The captain, Commander Gillespie, was himself on
the quarter-deck.  He was comparatively a young
man, probably not thirty, or about three years the
surgeon's senior.  He was a smart enough officer, but
he had good friends in England in high quarters, and
this had got him a separate command; so he walked
his own planks, lord of all he saw.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon and he were already very friendly,
only the captain did not put much faith in the
weather prognostications advanced by the worthy
Scotch medico.
</p>

<p>
"I told you what was coming, sir," said Dr. Reikie.
</p>

<p>
"Um&mdash;yes&mdash;well, I think you did mention something
about the glass.  But we're all right."
</p>

<p>
"Just shave Finisterre, won't we, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Just shave it! why, we can walk ten miles to
windward of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the <i>Gurnet</i> is a beauty anyhow, I will
admit that; but still, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, doctor: come down below and dine
with me&mdash;eh?&mdash;and we'll have a jolly good talk,
and leave service alone; shan't we?"
</p>

<p>
This was a very pretty way of telling the doctor
to mind his own business; and he wisely took the
hint, and went off down below to put on his mess-jacket.
</p>

<p>
The good fellow, however, was not altogether easy
in his mind.  He did not like the look of the glass,
nor&mdash;as he told the lieutenant, whom he met as he
passed through the ward-room to reach his cabin&mdash;the
look of things in general.  The clouds this evening
were racing across the sky, although it was now
almost too dark to see them; the wind was unsteady,
though very high; and there was a jerkiness in the
motion of the brave little ship that Dr. Reikie did
not half like.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Sturdy was putting on an oilskin coat
and a sou'-wester.  He was a rough-looking sea-dog
at the best, but arrayed in this style, his round, red,
clean-shaven face smiling rather grimly as the doctor
spoke to him, he looked more like a North Sea pilot
than the first officer of a British man-of-war.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy was a year or two older than the captain,
but he had no great friends at head-quarters, nor
anywhere else for the matter of that.  He came of
a good, honest Newcastle family.  His father owned
quite a small fleet of coal-steamers that plied between
that great city of the north and London or elsewhere.
In fact, these coal-ships coasted everywhere, going
high up as far as Aberdeen, and south even to Plymouth itself.
</p>

<p>
There was a larger steamer in which, being fond of
the sea, Mr. Sturdy, senior, had himself coasted for
years.  His wife was a tiny, delicate bit of a body,
and feared to venture much upon the ocean; but
Lieutenant Ben Sturdy here had sailed with his father
from the time when he was hardly as tall as the
binnacle.  It was a rough kind of a school to learn
in, but it made him a sailor, and even in the royal
navy an officer is none the worse of being a sailor.
What do you think, reader?
</p>

<p>
Well, Sturdy had entered the service before he was
fourteen, and had not been a deal on shore in England
since, because he had no interest to get him nice
ships that had only a three years' commission.  Sturdy's
ships had mostly been rotten old tubs that were kept
on a station may be for five years and then recommissioned,
two or three of the officers being left out
in them, perhaps.  So you see the service is not all
a bed of roses, but it is the best service in the world
for all that.  An old sailor like myself may be
excused for thinking so, at all events.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy was a good-natured fellow anyhow, although
sea-beaten and rough.  His daily life and
intercourse with his messmates proved that.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said the doctor, patronizingly;
"you're dressing up to fight the weather, I see."
</p>

<p>
"Dressing up to fight fiddlesticks, Reikie.  It's
going to be a bit of a blow, that's all, and I want
to be snug.  See!&mdash;Hullo, little man!" he added,
patting Jack on the head; "a bit squeamish, eh?
No?  All right; keep below for a few days."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gribble, the assistant-paymaster, was entering
the ward-room dressed in a uniform pilot-jacket, with
his cap well reefed, and his hands fathoms deep in
his trousers pockets.
</p>

<p>
He stuck himself right in the doorway, spreading
his elbows to steady himself.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he said, screwing his mouth and eyebrows
about as if his face were india-rubber&mdash;"hullo!
Who are you?  Hey?"
</p>

<p>
"Gangway, Mr. Cheek," answered Sturdy, "unless
you want me to give you a fair wind down the
hatchway there.  You'd look nice riding stride legs
on the shaft."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my blessed eyes, if it ain't you yourself,
Lieutenant Benjamin Sturdy!  Blow me sky-high if
I didn't think it was old Neptune come on board.  I
say, young man," he continued, "do you know that
a yellow oilskin and sou'-wester ain't uniform?  I'll
be obliged to take notice of it.  Sea-boots and all!"
</p>

<p>
Sturdy lifted a huge brown fist and made pretence
he was going to cut Gribble clean through the steerage.
</p>

<p>
Gribble dodged.  "Don't hit a little chap," he
cried.  "I'll let you off this time."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Sturdy," cried the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I'd get up steam if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted Sturdy from the depths of his
capacious chest; then he went stumping up the ladder
singing to himself,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darling of our crew;<br />
  No more he'll hear the billows howling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For death hath broached him to."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It did everybody good to hear Ben Sturdy singing;
but on the quarter-deck, except at night, this jolly
officer could be as polite as in a drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"O Mr. Sturdy," said Captain Gillespie, who was
still on deck; "here you are."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Been bending my foul-weather gear,
you see."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right.  Well, I think the old <i>Gurnet</i> is safe."
</p>

<p>
"As safe as can be, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Looks beastly thick to windward, though.  Think
we should get up steam?"
</p>

<p>
"As you please, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I was asking you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wouldn't.  We'll keep her up a point or
two; she'll weather anything."
</p>

<p>
"There!"
</p>

<p>
It was a bright flash of lightning that illuminated
everything on deck, till brass-work stood out like
burnished gold.
</p>

<p>
This was followed by a peal of thunder that
appeared to roll the ship up and crush her from stem
to stern as one would an empty match-box.
</p>

<p>
"That'll do good."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"It'll bring rain, and rain will lay the wind and
sea.  Hail will anyhow, and there it comes."
</p>

<p>
And there it did come too.  It was early spring;
but for as long as he had been to sea, Sturdy had
never before seen such hail as this.  In a few minutes'
time the decks were covered inches deep.  The
<i>Gurnet</i> might have been a ship in the Greenland seas.
The lightning, too, was incessant, and hail or snow
never looks more beautiful than when lit up in this
way.
</p>

<p>
The thunder rolled on almost incessantly, but the
wind now seemed less in force, and the sea for the
time being was as smooth as if covered with oil.
</p>

<p>
The man at the wheel cowered beneath the terrible
storm, while the hands forward were fain to seek the
protection of the weather-bulwarks.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go below now," said the captain when the
sky cleared once more and the thunder went
muttering away to leeward.  "Come down, Mr. Sturdy,
when your watch is over, and have a glass of port."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be with you, sir."
</p>

<p>
At eight o'clock he was as good as his word.
Dinner was over, but there were biscuits and dessert.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Mr. Sturdy.  The doctor and I have
been having long arguments on scientific subjects.
Sit down."
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!" said the surgeon.  "But, Captain Gillespie,
'argument' is the wrong word.  I was expatiating."
</p>

<p>
"Expawsheeatin'," mimicked Sturdy, as he helped
himself to the biscuit.  "You wouldn't listen to
argument, eh, from such as us?  You are learned.
You must just expawsheeate.  Says you,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I am Sir Oracle,<br />
  And, when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&mdash;Well, sir, what was Dr. Reikie teaching you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the captain, laughing, "just as you
came down we were away somewhere in the star
depths&mdash;beyond the nebulæ, I think."
</p>

<p>
Sturdy had poured himself out a glass of rum in
a tumbler&mdash;a sort of bos'n's nip, four fingers high.
This was a chance for the doctor to have a shot at
the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Sturdy," he said, "talking about <i>nebulæ</i>,
if you drink all that rum you'll have a nebulous
noddle in the mornin'."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," continued the captain, "we were off and
away into the vastness of the star depths.  We had
got far beyond Sirius, and never gone once on shore.
The doctor was telling me that light travels at the
rate of 186,000 miles a second!  I say, Mr. Sturdy,
how many knots is that an hour?"
</p>

<p>
"Computations like that, sir," said Reikie, trying
another shot, "it would be in vain for Sturdy to
attempt in his present condition.  Wait, sir, till he has
another nip."
</p>

<p>
Sturdy was silent.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy was hungry.  The biscuits disappeared before
him as if by magic.  Then he attacked the nuts,
and presently settled quietly down to the raisins.
</p>

<p>
Captain Gillespie's cabin was right abaft the wardroom,
with a separate staircase to it, and a steward's
pantry at the foot thereof.  It was very tastefully
furnished&mdash;at his own expense of course&mdash;and at one
end stood a small but good piano, and hanging near it
a fiddle.  The captain was very fond of music, and so
was the surgeon; and the fiddle belonged to the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Do play, sir," said Sturdy now, "to drown the
raging of the storm.&mdash;Come, Auld Reikie," he
continued, "screw up your Cremona."
</p>

<p>
"If you'll sing 'Tom Bowling.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll sing anything."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, sir," said Sturdy, after he had
finished that glorious song, which has never yet been
beaten, "would you mind me asking poor little
Mackenzie in for half-an-hour?  I am taking a great
liberty, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, my good fellow.&mdash;Mr. Reikie, will you
run for him? you're the younger."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mr. Dr.</i> Reikie will be delighted, sir."
</p>

<p>
This was a shot at the captain himself.  Reikie
really was a doctor of medicine, and he was just
young enough and Scotch enough to resent being
deprived of his title.
</p>

<p>
Jack was a little shy at first, but he soon brightened
up, and his pleasant and innocent chatter enlivened
the little company.  Jack even sung a song.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the captain at last, "this is only our
second night at sea, though I have known you two
gentlemen before.  Well, we've spent a very
pleasant evening, and if I can have my wish it won't be
the last by a long way.  We are going on particular
service, and are likely to be shipmates for a long
time.  Why, Midshipman Jack here will be a man
before he gets back to his mother."
</p>

<p>
Jack really fancied he had been a man for over
three weeks&mdash;ever since, in fact, he had set foot on
the <i>Gurnet</i> in Plymouth Sound.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen, I like to begin a cruise on
commission as we hope to end it&mdash;every one doing his
duty, every one pleasant, and loving his neighbour
as himself.  So, good-night.  See you all in the
morning."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But the wind grew wilder and wilder, and at
seven bells in the first watch it was found necessary
to get up steam.
</p>

<p>
The night was very clear now.  A half or three-quarter
moon had arisen, and every star shone like a
diamond.
</p>

<p>
Hark to that shout!
</p>

<p>
It is three bells in the morning watch, and the
senior midshipman's watch too.
</p>

<p>
Shoal water ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Hard a-port!"
</p>

<p>
Not a man fore or aft that did not hear that
shout, not a man fore or aft that did not spring at
once from cot or hammock.
</p>

<p>
And yet there was neither panic, fear, nor confusion;
and if every one did hasten on deck even before
the bos'n's pipe commenced to sound, it was
only because he knew he would be needed, and
because he wanted to know as speedily as possible
the extent of the danger, and the chance, if any, of
safety.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
JACK'S SEA-DADDY.
</h3>

<p>
Midshipman Jack was among the first on
deck.  All he could see was the star-lit,
wind-tossed waves that, at each dip of the good ship's
prow, rose like mountains right ahead, or, as she
leaned to leeward, seemed ready to engulf her.
</p>

<p>
But away on the port bow he could now and then
catch a glimpse of huge black boulders, over which
spume was dashing white and high.  These boulders
were the rocks on which the good <i>Gurnet</i> might soon
be dashed, and go to pieces.
</p>

<p>
In each lull of the gale, even already, the boom of
the breaking waves could be heard&mdash;a sound that had
been to many and many a sailor ere now the last he
had ever heard on earth.
</p>

<p>
Jack began to say his prayers, and to think of
those at home.  One and all of his friends and relations
seemed to rise up before his mind's eye at this
moment, and seemed to speak to him, to beckon to
him, to pray for him.
</p>

<p>
Poor Jack! his brain was all in a whirl, but
suddenly he remembered that he was guilty of a
breach of faith.  He had no business on deck.  The
surgeon had given him orders to remain below.  He
must hasten down, therefore, though it did seem
dreadful to be drowned in the dark&mdash;drowned like
a rat in a drain.  The companionship of even those
brightly-shining stars would have made death appear
less terrible.  But&mdash;yes, he must go below.  The first
duty of sailor or soldier is obedience.
</p>

<p>
He found his way at last into the ward-room, in
which the lamp was still burning, and threw himself
down on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
He could pray; ah! there was comfort in that.
After he had said his prayers&mdash;no, but prayed his
prayers; for there is a deal of difference between
saying a prayer and praying it: in the one it comes
welling up from the heart itself, in the other it is but
lip-worship&mdash;after he had prayed, he began to
repeat a psalm to himself, one that he had learned at
his mother's knee:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God is our refuge and our strength,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In straits a present aid;<br />
  Therefore, although the earth remove,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be afraid:<br />
  Though hills amidst the seas be cast;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though waters roaring make."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was just at this line that the young sailor boy's
thoughts were wafted away and away to hills and
glens and streams and woods, all basking in the sweet
light of the summer sun.
</p>

<p>
Jack was asleep and dreaming.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But a terrible time of anxiety was being passed by
those on deck.
</p>

<p>
The captain and Sturdy himself were both on the
little three-plank bridge, hanging on to the rope-rail
as if to a life-line.
</p>

<p>
Again and again Sturdy had shouted down the
tube, "Get up steam as fast as possible!"  Yet
down there he knew the engineer and stokers were
fighting like furies in the fierce heat of the
engine-room.  Well they knew how precious every minute,
nay, every second, was.  Bacon and even bladders of
lard were put into the fire, but apparently without
any result, although the flames roared high, and there
was even danger of firing the padding betwixt boilers and bunkers.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer loom the black rocks.  Can
they weather them?  All that brave ship can do the
<i>Gurnet</i> is doing.  She is sailing as close to the wind
as gull or frigate-bird.  All that brave men can think
of to save her has been done.
</p>

<p>
Again and again they imagine that they have
passed the worst; again and again whale-back rocks
rise ominously further ahead.
</p>

<p>
The captain, and even Sturdy, are now in despair,
and the last command is given,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stand by to man and lower boats!"
</p>

<p>
In such a case this would be the sailor's last resort.
In such a sea it would be all but hopeless.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy draws closer to the captain, and pointing with
one arm ahead, shouts in his ear, "We can't weather
it.  Our only chance is to keep her away and try to
sail between the rocks into the open water beyond."
</p>

<p>
The captain is about to assent, when a dark figure
is seen struggling up through the companion-hatch.
He is waving his hands aloft and shouting.  But the
wind cuts the words short off; they cannot be heard.
He rushes now to the bridge-ladder and clutches the
rope and shouts again.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy bends towards him.  He catches the words.
</p>

<p>
"Saved!" he cries, creeping back towards the
captain.
</p>

<p>
Saved?  I doubt it.  The ship's fore-part even
now touches ground, and the waves leap madly over
her.
</p>

<p>
But the screw is revolving at last, and slowly the
good ship begins to forge ahead.  It is a fight now,
and a hard one, betwixt wind and steam, and for a
time no one can tell which will be victor.
</p>

<p>
But, hurrah, science has conquered!  The useless
sails are taken in, and in less than half an hour the
<i>Gurnet</i> is clear, and away from the terrible reef.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There was nothing talked about at breakfast next
morning except the danger the ship had come through.
But what signifies danger to sailors, especially when
it is past?  The wind and sea had now gone down,
the fires were banked, and all sail was being made for
Gibraltar, that impregnable fortress whose splendid
story may never all be told, and the possession of
which is begrudged to us by almost every civilized
nation on the globe.
</p>

<p>
Britain means to hold it nevertheless, as long at
least as she rides mistress of the seas; as long as
there floats over us, in sea-fight or in tempest,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The flag that braved a thousand years<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle and the breeze."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By the time the <i>Gurnet</i> reached the Rock, Jack
was permitted to keep his watch.  He was attached
to Sturdy's, luckily for him.  Under this brave fellow
he would learn seamanship, a science that I am sorry
to say naval officers of our day do not know too
much about.
</p>

<p>
But Jack's hopes of spending a day on shore on
the historical Rock were doomed to disappointment.
For the <i>Gurnet</i> had not a clean bill of health.  One
or two cases of cholera had taken place, it was said,
at Plymouth before she sailed.  She had therefore
come from an infected port, and no one would be
allowed to set foot on shore.  The utmost indulgence
permitted was to post their letters.  A boat came
alongside for these.  They were handed over the side
and taken with a pair of tongs, being soon after
fumigated with tobacco smoke and the fumes of burning
brimstone.
</p>

<p>
Fruit, however, was handed up, and many other
dainties from shore.  The money received was
immediately plunged into a vase containing some acid
disinfectant.  Well, all this was provoking enough,
especially as there was not a sick man on board.
</p>

<p>
From the place where they lay waiting for important
documents, etc., they could see the soldiers on
the Rock and the promenaders near to the shore,
and at morn and eventide the sound of music stole
sweetly over the waters from military bands in
garrison or barracks.
</p>

<p>
Early though the season was, everything in and
around Gibraltar looked semi-tropical, and Jack
Mackenzie would have given a good deal, he thought, to
be allowed to land.  The sky was blue, and the sea
and scenery far and near lay quivering in the glorious
sunshine all day long.
</p>

<p>
When Jack turned out to keep the middle watch
for the first time, although rather sleepy when
aroused, he speedily pulled himself together, dressed,
and went on deck.  The stars were shining, but no
moon, and afar off was the town with its twinkling
lights, rising higher and higher up the hill.  Lower
down, closer to the water's edge, the lights were more
abundant; for sailing ships and steamers lay there,
and not far away a man-o'-war or two.
</p>

<p>
But the lights in the town grew fewer and fewer,
and the silence greater, till, after a time, little was to
be heard except the sentries calling, bells solemnly
tolling the hour, and now and then a wild, unearthly
yell which Jack could not account for.
</p>

<p>
He was leaning over the bulwarks, gazing towards
the great looming Rock, when a hand was placed on
his shoulder, and he looked quickly up to find it was
Sturdy's.
</p>

<p>
"Am I doing right?" said Jack.  "You see, I'm not
up to keeping watch yet.  Should I keep constantly
tramping up and down?"
</p>

<p>
Sturdy laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You'd soon have Auld Reikie using language if
you did.  It is while lying at anchor like this that
sailors sleep most lightly, and Reikie is nothing if
not a sailor.  Perhaps if you did much of the tramping
business, he'd come up the hatch and shy a boot
at you."
</p>

<p>
"Shy his boot at me!  Would he, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't say <i>his</i> boot, but <i>a</i> boot.  I
daresay Auld Reikie would just as soon shy somebody
else's, because when one does this sort of thing the
boot nearly always flies overboard.&mdash;But come and
sit down here on the skylight.  In keeping your
watch, you know, the main thing is to keep your
weather eye lifting, and to note what goes on high
and low, fore and aft.  See?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, let us yarn.  Tell me about your
brothers and sisters, mother and aunts, and&mdash;oh, but
of course you are far too young to have a sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"Nearly fourteen," said Jack proudly.  "Yes, I
have a sweetheart&mdash;just one."
</p>

<p>
"Well, one at a time is all I ever have&mdash;in the
same port, I mean.  And what is your young lady's
name?"
</p>

<p>
"She is the first young lady ever I spoke to in all
my life.  She is my cousin, eight years old, and her
name is Tottie Morgan.  Tottie isn't her baptismal
name, you know, only her brothers and sisters call
her that.  Her mother calls her Violet."
</p>

<p>
"And are you going to marry her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I suppose so."
</p>

<p>
"He, he!  Well, it's a long time to look forward to."
</p>

<p>
"Tottie's oldest brother is a perfect man; Llewellyn
is his name.  He is sixteen, and going to be a soldier,
and wear a feather bonnet."
</p>

<p>
"Fine fun that'll be.  Well, Jack, they say we'll soon
have war.  Then you will meet your cousin Llewellyn,
if he isn't killed in the first off-go.  Young fellows
often are, because they are so foolishly rash.  Soon
may it come."
</p>

<p>
"What, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the war.  I want my promotion; and if we
had plenty of fighting, in two or three years' time,
Jack, you too would win your epaulettes, and
exchange your toothpick for a cheese-knife."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, sir, I didn't hear you aright; did I,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Exchange your dirk, I mean, for a long sword;
that is, if we didn't have to expend a hammock on
you&mdash;bury you at sea, that is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I see, sir.  Then I couldn't marry Tottie,
could I, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No; you'd get out of that engagement."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I thought once I would like to be a
soldier, and wear a feather bonnet like father did;
but grandma said 'No!' so I had to be a sailor.
But I feel sure I shall like the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk, Jack.  Why, you haven't been a
dog-watch* in the service."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The two shortest watches on board ship,
from 4 to 6, and 6 to 8 p.m.,
are so called.  They are thus arranged
that the same men should not
come on deck always at the same hours.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"No, sir, I didn't know there was a dog on board."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!  Well, we have an old sea-dog in the
shape of a bos'n, and we have a cat too, a beauty,
but I don't like to see her taken out."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you like cats, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Not cats with nine tails.  But heave round, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Heave what round, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"O Jack, you'll be the death of me.  I mean
heave round with your yarn.  Tell me all about your
people while I light my pipe.  Never you learn to
smoke, Jack," he continued, lighting a match, and
holding it to the bowl of his meerschaum.  Puff,
puff, puff.  "It is one of the worst habits
out"&mdash;puff&mdash;"it weakens the heart"&mdash;puff&mdash;"weakens the
nerves"&mdash;puff, puff&mdash;"and I don't know what all
it doesn't do, but Dr. Reikie could tell you"&mdash;puff,
puff.  "Heave round, lad!"
</p>

<p>
Jack kept Lieutenant Sturdy interested for hours.
Somehow the boy felt that he had found in this
straightforward English sailor a true friend, and so
he never hesitated to tell him all the events of his
young life&mdash;all his trials and sufferings, and even his
aspirations.
</p>

<p>
And Sturdy listened attentively, sometimes patting
the boy's hand with true sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, well," said the lieutenant at last.  "I
thought I had roughed it in my young days, but
your story has the weather-gauge of mine, Jack&mdash;the
weather-gauge of mine.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, dear lad, I hope the worst is past.
You've just got to do your duty now, keep your
weather eye aloft, obey orders, and trust in God.
Your life afloat won't be all beer and skittles, I
assure you.  But a sailor's life isn't a bad one after
all.  I love it, Jack, oh yes, dearly.  You've got to
rough it now and then, but then you are here, there,
and everywhere, over all the world.  You see so
much and you learn so much, so that in many ways
sailors are far wiser than landsmen.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as long as you and I are shipmates, Jack,
just look upon me as your sea-daddy.  Come to me
if you have any difficulty, and I'll show you how to
steer out of it; and what you want to know about
the ship I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  You are so good I shall always
look upon you as my sea-father."
</p>

<p>
"Right; and if you want a sea-uncle&mdash;and that is
handy too at times&mdash;why, there's the bos'n.  He is a
roughish old swab like myself, but his heart is as soft
as a girl's.  He'll put you up to the ropes, and show
you how to splice and reef and steer.  Never despise
knowledge, no matter where it comes from; and if
you keep your place without being uppish, if you are
brave and bright, depend upon it, the men will love
you and respect you.  But I say, Jack, weren't you a
bit afraid the other night when it was blowing big
guns?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, sir, at first when all hands were
called to shorten sail, I thought I should go upstairs
and help."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"I was just going up, sir, when Dr. Reikie
caught me by&mdash;by a part of my dress, sir, and
pulled me down.  He made me a prisoner.  But I
did escape when I thought we were all going to be
drowned."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I went downstairs again and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you went below and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I fear I was very wicked; for I began
to say my prayers, and fell asleep in the middle of
them."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jack, it's eight bells&mdash;four o'clock.&mdash;Forward
there!  Eight bells!  Call the watch!"
</p>

<p>
Ring-ding, ring-ding, ring-ding, ring-ding.
</p>

<p>
Jack went quickly down below, and began to
undress.  He felt tired and sleepy now, and could
almost have gone to bed with his boots on.
</p>

<p>
His chest&mdash;it was not a large one&mdash;stood outside
the dispensary door.  There Jack knelt to pray.
</p>

<p>
Then he quickly caught hold of a ring in a beam,
and swung himself into his hammock.  He could do
so now without tumbling out again at the other side.
</p>

<p>
I think his head had hardly touched the pillow
when he was fast asleep&mdash;a happy, dreamless, sailor's
slumber.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
IN THE GOOD OLD "GURNET."
</h3>

<p>
Before Jack Mackenzie came to sea, he had
received, as far as any boy could, a thoroughly
theoretical education.  His grandmother had
seen to that.  Much she would have liked to have
the boy constantly with her, but she knew that this
would not be to his advantage; for when the very
best has been said about the system of what I may
call fireside education under a tutor, it must be
confessed that there is no emulation about it.  So Jack
had been sent to one of the best schools in Glasgow,
and had private tutors as well, one of them being
an old naval commander, who saw nothing derogatory
in coaching a few young fellows who were to serve
afloat.  For six months every year Jack had been
in Glasgow; the rest of the time he spent at
Drumglen and his mother's pretty cottage.
</p>

<p>
While in Glasgow, as was only to be expected, he
had spent many a pleasant day and evening at the
villa of his uncle and cousins the Morgans.  On
Sunday he never failed to put in an appearance
dressed and ready for church.  But the Sabbath
evenings he had used to spend as often as not with
Mrs. Malony and Little Peter.
</p>

<p>
During his intercourse with his cousins, independent
of his falling in love, as he termed it, with the
tiny but old-fashioned Tottie, he had cemented a
close and enduring friendship with the elder boy,
Llewellyn.
</p>

<p>
Ah, reader! friendships like these are very sweet.
Wherever in all the wide world we roam, we never,
never forget them.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn at sixteen was very tall and handsome,
and in every way, one would say, cut out for a
soldier.  If his father was Welsh, his mother was a
true Scot; he was therefore Celtic to the core.  It
is no wonder, then, that he should prefer a cadetship
in a Highland regiment to that in any other.  The
93rd is most assuredly one of the grandest and
gallantest of our Scottish regiments, and has
maintained its high renown on many a blood-stained field.
</p>

<p>
Just one thing I must say in favour of Jack's
conservative old grandma.  Although then she neither
loved the Welsh nor liked business people, she did not
now go the whole length of ostracizing her daughter
and her family.  I suppose old age has a softening
effect upon the heart, for she even went so far as to
invite her daughter and children now and then to
Drumglen.  The latter went frequently to see the
old lady, but her daughter very seldom, for the
simplest and best of reasons&mdash;namely, that her husband
had not been included.
</p>

<p>
However, Llewellyn became a special favourite
with this stern old dame, and so did Baby Morgan&mdash;that
is, Jack's wee sweetheart, Tottie or Violet.
What glorious days the two boys had spent together
on the loch, by the riverside, in the forests&mdash;dark
even in daylight&mdash;or wandering over the purple hills!
Never, never would they forget these dear days while
in camp or field, in the trenches, or far away on the
lone blue sea.
</p>

<p>
There had been tears of genuine grief coursing
down Jack's cheeks when he bade Llewellyn farewell
at last; and though older, it must be confessed
that the young cadet was glad in a measure when
the parting was over, for there was a big lump in
his throat that he had tried in vain to swallow.
</p>

<p>
Little Tottie, now nearly nine years of age, was
not, truth compels me to say, so very much affected
at bidding her lover good-bye as Jack, who had a
large spice of romance in him, would have liked.
She did not cry&mdash;not she.  Her last words, as the
train was starting and Jack was leaning over the
window, might have been said to smack of selfishness
and gore.
</p>

<p>
"Mind, Johnnie," she cried, "to bring me home
somefing very nice, and don't fo'get to kill lots and
lots of dead sailors."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There was no naval instructor on board the <i>Gurnet</i>,
of course; but Jack determined to study, nevertheless,
theoretically as well as practically.  Well, he found
himself among good friends, always willing to help
him out of a hole.  There were the doctor and second
master down below, and there was Lieutenant Sturdy,
his sea-dad, on deck, and the rough but kindly bos'n
forward.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fitzgerald, the senior midshipman, was a tall,
lanky young fellow, the younger son of a lord, and
though no doubt clever enough after a fashion, he
did not see the fun, he said, of studying anything in
particular.  "Zeal for the service!" he told Sturdy
once; "I haven't got any.  There is no extra screw
for that; and if my brother dies, I shall go on shore
and keep my hunters."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gribble, the assistant-paymaster, was the tease
of the mess.  He could sing a rattling good comic
song, however, and spin good yarns&mdash;all true, he
said, because he himself had made them up.  So he
was rather a favourite in the little mess.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, the members of the ward-room mess
were fairly well met, and lived as jolly a life as the
same number of young fellows could live anywhere.
</p>

<p>
From Gibraltar they went cruising away down
the Mediterranean, for the <i>Gurnet</i> carried important
dispatches for Malta.  They were not put in quarantine
here.  They just escaped that, having been detained
at sea by contrary winds.  Yes, they might
have steamed; but Captain Gillespie's orders had been
to save coals if possible, and never to light fires if
there was wind enough to carry the ship along.
</p>

<p>
At Malta, then, much to his delight, Jack got on
shore.  The doctor, who was assistant-surgeon in
charge, and could do very much as he liked, took
Jack with him.
</p>

<p>
What long letters our little hero had to write about
this strange town, with its streets of stairs, its
quaintly-dressed inhabitants, its bumboat men and women,
its churches, with bells that jangle-jangled on for ever
and ever; its bazaars and fortifications and ships, and
its hill, or rather brae, on which a wood was said to
exist.  Dr. Reikie went to this wood on a butterfly
expedition, and in search of fossils.  Well, the wood
itself seemed a fossil, a most forlorn and dilapidated
belt of trees indeed.  But the doctor and Jack came
back laden with specimens, white with dust, and with
faces that seemed to have been rubbed with a wet brick.
</p>

<p>
The only thing worth seeing about Malta, said
Lord Tomfoozle, as the doctor called Fitzgerald, the
senior mid, was the opera.  So he did not miss that
for a single night of the ten days the <i>Gurnet</i> lay in
Malta.  I fear that in one respect Fitzgerald rather
gave himself away, as the Yankees express it; for he
assured everybody before coming to Malta that he
could speak Italian.  Well, when he aired this
language for the first time at a good hotel kept by a
native of sunny Italia, the landlord shrugged his
shoulders and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"De Rooshian langwidge," he said, "I not can;
but de Engleese mooch plenty, sare."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie, who was there, guffawed.  It was very
rude.  Fitzgerald turned red in the face, then he
called the doctor a bear, and left the hotel.
</p>

<p>
But the doctor, or doctor's mate as some old tars
on board would call him, was too good a fellow to
take offence at being called a bear by young
Tomfoozle; so at dinner that day he was extra civil to
him, and asked him twice if he would have some
more pudding.  Dr. Reikie knew the mid's weakness,
and what would soften his heart; so presently my
lord smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I accept your apology, doctor," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Apology, Tomfoozle?  I didn't make one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you did.  You asked me twice to have
pudding.  Pudding and apology are&mdash;er&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Synonymous?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the word.  I called you a bear to-day,
doctor, but I meant a brick."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he meant a brick, did he?" chimed in the A.P.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A.P. is the abbreviation for assistant-paymaster.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Mr. Sturdy, please take note; Lord Tomfoozle
meant a brick."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you A.P.," cried the mid, "or rather you
APE.  I'm talking to a gentleman.&mdash;Yes, doctor, I
did mean a brick; so there!"
</p>

<p>
"I say, doctor, you look out," said the mischievous
quill-driver.  "Old Tomfoozle expects you to put him
on the sick-list next&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Next what?" said the mid.
</p>

<p>
"Next gale of wind."
</p>

<p>
"Avast heaving now, you youngsters," put in
Sturdy.&mdash;"That's the worst of having babies in the
mess, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't heave anything," said Fitzgerald; "but if
the biscuits had been handy, Mr. A.P., without the E,
would have had to duck his somewhat empty head."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
I cannot say that Jack Mackenzie was over-well
pleased with the city of the Templars.  It was foreign
enough and romantic enough, and military enough
also, but it lacked greenness and vegetation.  True,
the orange-trees bloomed bonnie in many of the
gardens, and flowers too, rich and rare, but on the
whole it was a parched and sunburnt town.  The sea
all around, however, was very blue and beautiful, and
perhaps no one was sorry when the <i>Gurnet</i> was once
more off and away on the bosom of the broad Levant,
and bound for Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
The ship was now all that a little ship of war should
be.  Sturdy took a pride in her.  And he would have
her clean alow and aloft, outside and in; and the men
seeing this, did all they could to please their good
lieutenant.  The principal warrant or non-commissioned
officers on board the <i>Gurnet</i> were the bos'n,
who was so good a friend to Jack, the quartermaster,
and sergeant of marines.  There were ten at least of
these redcoats on board; and although they were
very plainly dressed indeed on week-days&mdash;just sloped
about anyhow, as the bos'n phrased it&mdash;still, drawn up
on the ivory-white deck on a Sunday morning in line
with the blue-jackets, all with rifles and white bayonets
ready for inspection, the effect was very pretty.
</p>

<p>
On the Sabbath morning, as Dr. Reikie solemnly
called this holy day, divisions of course formed quite
an event.  The officers were all in frock-coats and
swords, except Jack, who was lashed to his dirk.  The
best and biggest flag floated gaily aloft, and if a
breeze was blowing, the <i>Gurnet</i>, with every white sail
bellying out before it, looked indeed a thing of life
and beauty.  Down below on deck there wasn't a
rope's end out of place; the hammocks were neatly
arranged above the bulwarks, and the brass-work
shone like the inside of a good gold watch.
</p>

<p>
Solemnly along the line of sailors and marines
marched the captain, followed by Sturdy, followed in
his turn by Dr. Reikie, and there was nothing that
escaped the eagle eyes of any of the three.  The
men's very faces and ears came in for inspection, and
even the cut and length of their hair, the hang of
their knives, the lay of their lanyards; and if a
bluejacket's collar was badly and carelessly spread, or if
it were too broad or too narrow, the quartermaster's
attention was drawn thereto.
</p>

<p>
To appear with a dirty face on a Sunday morning
was indeed a crime.  The captain would call attention
to it, perhaps as follows: "Is that man's face clean
and wholesome, Dr. Reikie?"
</p>

<p>
"It's waur* than a brookie's, sir; and look, his
lugs&dagger; are like midden creels."&Dagger;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Waur," worse.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
&dagger; "Lugs," ears.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
&Dagger; "Midden creels," baskets used
in the Highlands of Scotland for
carrying manure to the fields.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There were times, you see, when the English
language would hardly meet the demands of the case,
and then the honest doctor permitted himself to drift
into his dearly-beloved native dialect.
</p>

<p>
"Bring that man before me to-morrow forenoon,
quartermaster."
</p>

<p>
That man would next day be planked accordingly,
and perhaps his grog stopped for a week, or, if the
ship were in harbour, his leave stopped.
</p>

<p>
A milder punishment for milder offences was
three-water grog.  In this case the men to be punished
were drawn up amidships, each with a basin in his
hand; and into this was poured his grog, very much
diluted indeed.  Then came the command, "Caps off.
Queen!"
</p>

<p>
"Queen!" each man would repeat, and thus toasting
Her Gracious Majesty, toss off his three-water
grog.
</p>

<p>
I have already said there was no naval instructor
on board, neither was there a parson.  Now, the duty
of reading prayers in such cases devolves, I think, on
the captain himself, but on board the saucy <i>Gurnet</i>
it was turned over to the first lieutenant.  He had
a deep, strong voice, which he could make singularly
impressive when reading the lessons.
</p>

<p>
It was rather more than impressive on one particular
occasion, shortly after the ship sailed from Malta.  It
was a very lovely day indeed, and church service was,
as usual, held on the upper deck abaft the mainmast.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy stood by the capstan reading, and more
than one officer had been noticing the antics of
Fred Harris, a young blue-jacket, a first-class boy,
who was doing all he could to make his comrades
laugh.  His conduct had evidently given Lieutenant
Sturdy the fidgets; for, much to everybody's surprise,
the service did not conclude that morning with the
simple "Amen," but Amen with a pennant to it, as
a sailor would say.  It ran thus, all in one breath,
mind you: "Amen!&mdash;Harris, confound you, sir, I've
been watching you all the time.  You'll have the
cat for your shocking irreverence, as sure as my
name's Sturdy.&mdash;Pipe down!"
</p>

<p>
Well, it was time to pipe down after this.
</p>

<p>
<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The above anecdote is perfectly true, but
any reader who doesn't like the tone of it is welcome
to skip it.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
If the reader will take a glance at the map, he will
notice that Sicily is a large island lying to the south
and west of the extreme end of Italy, which
good-naturedly curls round as if to meet it and bid it
welcome.  Sicily is principally celebrated, Mr. Sturdy
told Jack one night in the middle watch, for good
fruit, bad garlic, fried fish, brigands, and a burning
mountain.
</p>

<p>
"That would be Mount Etna," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, old Jack; that's her name.  There is a navy
yarn told about that mountain which I'm not sure I
should tell you, although I was told it myself by a
priest."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, tell me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a warning to all contractors anyhow,
who sometimes supply very bad biscuits to England's
fighting navy.  Once upon a time, then, when the
gallant <i>Roarer</i>, a shoudy-boudy old seventy-four, and
terribly badly found in the matter of hard tack&mdash;her
biscuits being half dust, half weevils&mdash;was cruising
around here, the officer of the watch, one dark night
in the middle watch, called all hands to witness a
terrible but somewhat ridiculous sight.
</p>

<p>
"The ship was sailing close past Sicily, and not far
from Etna, which had been in eruption for some
weeks; only they appeared to be burning up the slack
and the cinders in the crater just then, because there
was plenty of light but not much smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Well, all hands came tumbling up, thinking
perhaps a Frenchman was bearing down upon them, and
that they wouldn't have any more sleep till they sent
her to Davy Jones's locker.
</p>

<p>
"But it wasn't that.
</p>

<p>
"The captain himself stood on the poop, with his
battered old telescope to his eye, and turned towards
the mountain top.
</p>

<p>
"The eyes of all the crew were now bent in the
same direction.  No wonder that they stared in
astonishment, rubbed their eyes, and stared again.  For
there, on the very brink of the crater, stood two tall
figures, wrestling, as it were, for the mastery.  One
was speedily made out to be Mr. Pipeclay, a baker of
Portsmouth, who supplied biscuits to the royal
navy&mdash;biscuits that had been once or twice on a voyage
round the world in the merchant service.*  The other
figure was soon discovered by the captain to be none
other than Auld Nickie Ben himself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* I know for a fact that, not longer ago than the sixties, old
ship-biscuits that had been several cruises
in whalers and sealers to the
Arctic regions, and condemned,
were bought up and sold to the navy.
Poor Jack!

<p>
"'Yes,' shouted the captain, 'it is Nick himself.  I
can distinctly make out the cloven hoof.&mdash;Bravo, Nick,
that's got him!'
</p>

<p>
"Then he took the glass from his eye and shouted
to the commander,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Heave her to, Mr. Deadlight; we must see the
end of this.'
</p>

<p>
"The ship was hove to very quickly indeed, and
the crew lined the bulwarks and hung like bees to the
rigging, and meanwhile the terrible struggle on the
mountain top went on.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Britons are proverbially lovers of fair-play,
and in this case they extended their patronage to the
baker and Nick without favour.
</p>

<p>
"The baker was evidently trying to pull away from
the crater, while the object of the other combatant
was to get his antagonist down the awful pit.
</p>

<p>
"On board the ship there was wild shouting or
cheering, as one or other seemed to gain an advantage,
with loud cries of 'Pull, baker, pull,' or 'Pull, Nick,
pull,' as the case might be.
</p>

<p>
"But at last, terrible to relate, the baker was
floored and flung in; Auld Nickie Ben, with an
eldritch scream, dived after him, the last portion of
him seen being his hoof.
</p>

<p>
"A clap of thunder followed, and soon after that
it came on to blow such a fearful gale that for
four-and-twenty hours the good ship <i>Roarer</i> was scudding
under bare poles, and it is just a wonder that she
survived to tell the tale."

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
PADDY'S ADVENTURE&mdash;FRED HARRIS PROVES<br />
HIMSELF A HERO.
</h3>

<p>
Though far wilder scenes and adventures must
soon engage our attention, I shall linger just
a little longer in the blue Levant before we sail away
south and round the world.  Alexandria, then, where
Jack was permitted to land and enjoy himself pretty
much as he pleased, he liked, probably on this very
account.  Our hero was certainly not allowed an
unlimited amount of pocket-money, but he had enough;
besides, you know, it was impossible to spend any at
sea, for no card-playing for money was permitted on
board the <i>Gurnet</i>.
</p>

<p>
An Egyptian offered to be his guide, and Jack
accepted his services.  A lithe and saucy-looking
tatterdemalion he was, from his greasy skull-cap to his
bare brown toes.  He took Jack everywhere, and
showed him all the sights.  At Pompey's Pillar he
met a crowd of blue-jackets not belonging to his
own ship.  They had flown a kite over the pillar
and drawn a rope up, and several sailors went hand
over hand up to the top.  They danced on the top,
and they drank on the top.  It made Jack's head
giddy to look at them, for he could not help
noticing that some of them were not perfectly sober.
</p>

<p>
Presently he was horrified to see one young sailor
lose his balance and topple over.  What followed
illustrated the presence of mind of a British tar in
a way that I think has never been beaten.  He was
standing near Jack when the man fell.
</p>

<p>
"Haul taut above!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Then in the twinkling of an eye he loosened the
rope below.  It is no exaggeration to say that in
less than two seconds he had full command of the
line, and in two seconds more he had coiled a bight
of it round the falling sailor.
</p>

<p>
"Now lower away from aloft!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
The man had been caught by body and legs when
about half-way down, and was now lowered easily to
the ground.
</p>

<p>
He was partially insensible, but otherwise intact.
</p>

<p>
"That's the way we catches Cape pigeons," said
the man who had so cleverly saved his shipmate's life.
</p>

<p>
Jack begged him to explain.
</p>

<p>
"Why, young sir," he said, "it's simple enough.
Near the Cape, you know, and up the 'Bique, the birds
come sailing round astern of the ship to pick up the
crumbs.  Well, we just tie a line to a chunk o' wood
and pitches it overboard.  When a bird flies near it, we
loosens the line like, and a turn of the wrist entangles
him; then on board he comes straight off the reel."
</p>

<p>
In a hotel in one of the beautiful squares Jack
dined that day in solitary grandeur.
</p>

<p>
When he went on board again, he told his adventures
to his messmates.
</p>

<p>
"I say, little 'un," said Gribble, the assistant-paymaster,
"you're getting on.  I thought I was a bit of
a liar myself, but&mdash;  Steward, another cup o' tea."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jack, in a disheartened kind of way,
"I don't see the value of truthfulness if one isn't to
be believed."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Jack!" cried Dr. Reikie.  "I believe you.
What you have told us is doubtless true.  The clever
feat is scientifically possible; but, alas! to talk science
to Gribble there is like throwing pearls before&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Before what, Mister Learned Scot?"
</p>

<p>
"Before&mdash;  Steward, another cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
The advantages of temperance are nowadays well
recognized by the men themselves in the royal navy;
but in those times it was nothing unusual to find the
men come off in the liberty-boat "fechtin' fou," as
Dr. Reikie called it&mdash;that is, to put it plain, "fighting
drunk."  Sometimes they had to be put in irons on
account of their violence.  This was not perhaps so
much owing to the amount they disposed of as to
the vile nature of the stuff they drank.
</p>

<p>
When Midshipman Jack was one day sent on
shore with a boat's crew and some letters at
Alexandria, he felt himself a very important officer
indeed.  He had orders also to make a call and wait
for a reply, but to be off again within two hours.
He got down to his boat in plenty of time, singing
to himself.  He sang another song, though, when he
found only one man at the boat.
</p>

<p>
He lowered his brows, and demanded to know
where the others were.
</p>

<p>
"Only gone up to drink the Queen's health, God
bless her!" said Paddy O'Rayne.
</p>

<p>
"But I gave them strict orders not to leave the boat."
</p>

<p>
"Bhoys will be bhoys, yer honor.  But if you'll
stand by her head here, sorr, troth I'll bring them
all in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Away went Paddy.
</p>

<p>
In an hour's time, and when Jack was almost in
tears, down came two men&mdash;they were singing.  Then
came Paddy&mdash;he was reeling.  Then two more&mdash;one
with a black eye.  Jack would wait no longer, but
shoved off.
</p>

<p>
Three times did the stroke oar catch a crab; the
third time he couldn't get up, and Paddy took his
place.
</p>

<p>
In order to get alongside safely and gracefully,
he made a kind of admiral's sweep, much to the
amusement of Dr. Reikie and Lieutenant Sturdy, who
were both on the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
"In bow!"
</p>

<p>
"Way enough!  Oars!"
</p>

<p>
The bow stood up, boat-hook in hand.
</p>

<p>
He tried to do so very gracefully&mdash;too gracefully
in fact; for in reaching out to catch on, he lost his
balance.  He was fished out after a time; and so
Jack and his merry men got up the side.
</p>

<p>
Our young hero made his report very sadly; but
Sturdy only laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I merely sent you," he said, "to give you experience.
Sailors are just like babies, you know, and
want a lot of watching to keep them out of mischief."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," said Reikie.  "Why, I remember
once when in the old gunboat <i>Rattler</i>, on the coast
of Africa, having ten men down with sickness all in
one day.  I thought we were struck with cholera
till I made inquiry, and found it was 'pine-apple
ailment.'  They had all been on shore at Zanzibar, and
pine-apples were cheap.  Well, Sturdy, would you
believe, one man told me that '<i>sure, he'd only eaten
nine!</i>'"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In two months' time the <i>Gurnet</i> was at anchor at
Constantinople.  This was Jack's first visit to the
capital of the Turk, but it wasn't to be his last by
any means.
</p>

<p>
Just one little story here concerning Paddy O'Rayne.
</p>

<p>
Paddy was a sailor-soldier, you must know; in
other words, he was a red marine.  He belonged to
the R.M.L.I., or Royal Marine Light Infantry.  They
are called infantry, not to distinguish them from
cavalry&mdash;for there are no horse marines&mdash;but from
the R.M.A., or Royal Marine Artillery.  These red
marines are really splendid fellows, and, as a rule,
men of grand physique.  It is said that they take
up as much room on parade as the "gallant Forty-twa,"
though my own opinion is that the Highlanders
could give them yards and beat them.  Never mind,
Paddy was a capital specimen; and he "did for the
doctor"&mdash;that is, he was the worthy surgeon's servant,
and sometimes even assisted in the sick-bay.
</p>

<p>
As regards drinking, Dr. Reikie had always
considered him fairly temperate, and had never missed a
drop out of his own bottle of rum, which was taken
up for him once a week.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw you the worse of drink yet," said
the doctor to him one day, by way of compliment.
</p>

<p>
"Indade! thin, sorr," said Paddy, "the raison is
just this: I niver dhrink more than one glass at a
time.  Sure, sorr, me mouth wouldn't hould a dhrop
more."
</p>

<p>
But, alas! during this visit to Constantinople proof
was forthcoming that even Paddy was not invariably
infallible.
</p>

<p>
Paddy was granted a day's leave then to go on
shore and see the "unspakeable Turk."  He was as
natty as a new pin when he passed over the side to
take his place in the liberty-boat.
</p>

<p>
But when that same boat came off with the liberty-men
at night, behold Paddy was not there.  Nor did
he appear next day, nor till the middle of the next,
when he came on board.  His appearance as he came
in over the side was, to say the least, sufficient to
make him the cynosure of all eyes.  He had nothing
on at all except a pair of old blue drawers and a
brass cavalry helmet.  His face was fearfully
disfigured.  But heedless of the peals of laughter that
greeted him from all hands, he marched boldly aft to
where Dr. Reikie stood on the quarter-deck, saluted,
and reported himself.
</p>

<p>
"It's me, sorr," he said, "and sorra a one else."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Paddy, I wouldn't have known you.  Get
down at once to the sick-bay, and I'll see you there."
</p>

<p>
There were three parallel scars on Paddy's face&mdash;brow,
nose, and chin&mdash;thus <img src="images/img-144.jpg" alt="3 bars" />.  The excuse he pleaded,
when asked how he managed to injure himself, was as
droll as Paddy himself.
</p>

<p>
"You, see, sorr, it was like this.  I was aslape on
the floor as innocent as an unborn lamb, sorr, and
when I awoke I found the stove had thrown itself
down and the bars had burnt me face."
</p>

<p>
But he spoke as if the stove had been lying on his
face for quite a long time.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie forgave him.
</p>

<p>
The officers of the <i>Gurnet</i> managed to enjoy themselves
very much at Constantinople, and were everywhere
well received.  There were other ships here too,
and so the fun was pretty general.
</p>

<p>
After leaving the Turkish capital, the <i>Gurnet</i>
returned to Alexandria and Malta and Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
The reason was that there was then no Suez Canal,
else the saucy craft would have steamed right away
through into the Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
Round the Cape she must go therefore, but nobody
minded this.  The Cape of Good Hope is rather a
pleasant station than otherwise; and, besides, time is
of no object with a ship just newly commissioned, for
throe or four years being a very long time to look
forward to, no one thinks of looking.
</p>

<p>
The ship touched at Madeira, then stood straight
away south&mdash;with not much easterly in it&mdash;for
Ascension and St. Helena.
</p>

<p>
After many days' sailing they sighted the beautiful
Canary Islands, and then the Cape de Verd Islands,
getting pretty close to one which I think was
St. Antonio.  But they did not land, for the breeze was
a spanking trade, and carried them on and on all day
and all night, as if their ship had been a fairy ship
and the sea around a fairy sea.
</p>

<p>
There was certainly not much in the shape of
adventure, however, and not a deal to be seen; although
Dr. Reikie, ever busy in the pursuit of science, found
much in that deep-blue sparkling ocean to interest
him: for he trailed little open gauze nets overboard,
and the animalcules that he caught thus and spread
out on black card-board with the aid of needles were
extremely beautiful to behold.  It needed good eyes
to see some of the worthy medico's specimens, however.
Here, for instance, were tiny transparent fishes,
seemingly, all perfect and complete, yet so small they could
have swum easily through the eye of a bodkin; little
star-fish too, and the drollest and daftest looking
shrimps you could imagine, and these were no bigger
than the head of an old-fashioned pin.  Under a large
magnifying-glass, however, you could see even the
hearts of these little fishes beating.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't it wonderful!" Dr. Reikie would say;
"and to think that God made them all, and every tiny
blood-vessel in their bits of bodies."
</p>

<p>
One night about five bells in the first watch there
was a cry of, "Man overboard."
</p>

<p>
This was quickly followed by the bos'n's pipe&mdash;"Away,
lifeboat's crew."
</p>

<p>
But who was it?  Everybody looked about on deck
or below to see if they missed a messmate.
</p>

<p>
Rattle-rattle, rumble-tumble, how those good fellows
fly on deck!  Hardly a minute elapses ere the
boat reaches the water on a level keel and with a dull
plash.  Then there are the swish of the oars, and the
clunk-clunk in the rowlocks, as she speeds away
astern.
</p>

<p>
The life-buoy has been lit and let go, and is burning
brightly enough far away astern yonder, and as
speedily as possible the ship is hove to.
</p>

<p>
For that life-buoy the men are now steadily pulling
as if their own lives depended on the strength of their
brawny arms, while the sub-lieutenant himself as
coxswain stands tiller in hand in the stern sheets.
</p>

<p>
What a long pull it seems to be!  But they reach
the beacon light at last.
</p>

<p>
No soul is clinging there!
</p>

<p>
But a huge shark appears for a moment in the
bright starlight, swims half-way round the buoy, and
disappears with an ugly plash.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, lads," says the officer, "that tiger of the seas
has had his supper.  We can do no more.  Stand by
to ship the buoy."
</p>

<p>
This was got inboard and steadied forward in the
bows, and after pulling around slowly for a short
time, the lifeboat was headed once more for the now
distant ship.
</p>

<p>
"Pull easy, men&mdash;pull easy."
</p>

<p>
The poor fellows were terribly pumped.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" cried the first-class boy Harris.  "Did
you hear that cry, sir?"
</p>

<p>
It was the same lad who had been planked by
Sturdy for skylarking in church: a bold and fearless
young fellow he was.
</p>

<p>
"Hark, sir, there it is again!"
</p>

<p>
"Lie on your oars, men.&mdash;You must have 'cute ears,
boy.  I heard nothing."
</p>

<p>
There wasn't a sound now except the "jabble" or
lapping of the water as the boat moved slowly up and
down.  The night was delightfully clear; the stars
so bright and near it seemed as though they were not
many oars' lengths overhead.  The Southern Cross was
particularly brilliant.  No clouds in the sky except
a few rock-and-tower-shaped ones low down on the
western horizon, behind which the tropical lightning
played intermittently.
</p>

<p>
But never a sound.
</p>

<p>
"Hark again!" cried Harris.
</p>

<p>
Yes; every one heard it now&mdash;far down to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"It is but the cry of a bird," said the officer.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a Mother Carey's chicken," said the
stroke.
</p>

<p>
"Round with her, lads," cried Sub-Lieutenant Wilson.
"Give way port.  Off she dances.  We'll soon see."
</p>

<p>
The beacon light was out, but a lantern was hung
up, and away went the lifeboat.  Though I say life-boat,
reader, remember she was but an ordinary whaler.
</p>

<p>
After pulling for some time, they could hear the
cries ahead distinctly enough.
</p>

<p>
They answered with a vigorous shout, and redoubled
their efforts, for the cries were unmistakably those of
a drowning man.
</p>

<p>
They ceased entirely after a time.
</p>

<p>
The good crew were in despair.  They listened and
listened in vain, and were just putting about, when
Harris dropped his oar, to the astonishment of
everybody, and sprang overboard like a flash.
</p>

<p>
In the side of a dark curling wave he had seen a
white face.  Next minute he was ploughing along
back towards the boat with one hand, while with the
other he supported the form of the drowned or
drowning man.
</p>

<p>
It was the doctor himself.  While hauling in his
net as he sat in the dinghy that hung from the davits
astern, he had somehow slued it and gone head foremost
into the sea.
</p>

<p>
For a long time he gave no signs of life.  But his
wet clothing was speedily taken off, and he was laid
on the men's coats.  After fully half an hour of
rubbing and rolling, he gave a sigh and opened his eyes.
A little flask of brandy was held to his lips, a
portion of which he managed to swallow.  He speedily
revived now, and by the time they got him on board
he was able to tell his story.  He did not swim to
the life-buoy, he said, because it was watched by a
demon shark that would undoubtedly have taken
him down.
</p>

<p>
Next day he was able to resume his duties; but
that boy Fred Harris was the hero of the ship for
many a week after this strange adventure.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
A TRAGEDY&mdash;AULD REIKIE PURSUES SCIENCE<br />
UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
</h3>

<p>
For nine months, if not longer, the <i>Gurnet</i> cruised
around the Cape, and along the east coast of
Africa, as high up as the tropics, and as low down as
Algoa Bay.  She took a run round once as far as
Simon's Bay.
</p>

<p>
Jack Mackenzie felt himself now to be a boy no
longer.  He had grown taller, broader, and, I may
add, browner.
</p>

<p>
Who could have foretold that the little ragged
guttersnipe boy whom big Tom Morgan found on that
snowy Christmas eve, and took pity upon, would have
developed into so manly a young officer, walking the
quarter-deck of one of Her Majesty's cruisers, and
feeling fit almost to keep a watch all by himself.
</p>

<p>
We next find the <i>Gurnet</i> at anchor in Bombay
roadstead or harbour.  She looked small, indeed,
beside some of the great East Indiamen lying here,
and almost hidden in the forest of masts everywhere
around her.
</p>

<p>
At this time the walls of Bombay were still standing,
and a ditch ran round a great portion of it.  The
British town was therefore far more gloomy than it
is now, and the native town perhaps a deal dirtier, if
that were possible.  Nevertheless, Jack used to enjoy
a run on shore with his friend the doctor, for there
was much to be seen and much to study from a
natural history point of view.  So they never came
off without specimens of some kind.
</p>

<p>
"If I had a year to myself," said Dr. Reikie, "I
would spend it in studying anthropology and zoology
in the old and new towns of Bombay."
</p>

<p>
Well, as regards these, one might go further and
fare worse.
</p>

<p>
But every creature and human being, except restless
Europeans, seemed calm and contented here.  The
doctor and Jack, after a time, got into a habit of
just wandering about in the glorious sunshine and
looking at things, or they would hire a buggy and
make the buggy-wallah drive slowly about.  A palkee
or palanquin was another method of progression the
two sometimes adopted.  They made the bearers walk
abreast, so that they could converse from their
respective windows, or ports, as Dr. Reikie called
them.
</p>

<p>
A palanquin is really a kind of sedan chair, borne
along on a long bamboo pole by half-naked natives;
only, instead of sitting you lie at full length.  My
own experience of palkees leads me to say that in
such a mode of travelling one enjoys the <i>dolce far
niente</i> to perfection, and people and things flit past
you as if they were part and parcel of a beautiful
dream, or the transformation scene in a pantomime.
The natives are picturesque in the extreme&mdash;turbanned
Arabs; swarthy Parsees; fat Hindus; native
servants of every description; lazy blue-dressed native
policemen; British soldiers in scarlet coats; British
blue-jackets; solemn-looking little cows with humps
and gilded horns; rings of workmen squatting on the
foot-path smoking opium; droll-looking birds called
adjutants, that, assisted by the bluebottle flies, do all
the scavenging; and, last but not least, rows of pretty
maidens, dressed in rolls of silk of various colours;
with here and there bevies of beautiful children.
The whole forms a picture that never passes from the
mind away.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> next went to Ceylon.
</p>

<p>
While on her voyage thither some stock-taking was
done, and, to Captain Gillespie's astonishment, the rum
was short.
</p>

<p>
Who could the thief be?  No one could get into the
spirit-room without the assistant-paymaster's orders
or Lieutenant Sturdy's.  It was extremely puzzling.
A watch was kept on the door, nevertheless; but
nothing was found out.  Still the rum disappeared&mdash;more,
that is, than was taken out honestly.  A small
cask was taken up every day at twelve.  The bung
was started, and the spirit drawn off with a siphon.
Then the cask was returned.
</p>

<p>
It was a case for a detective.
</p>

<p>
And that detective was forthcoming in the person
of Auld Reikie, as his messmates frequently called
the honest doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I have it, Sturdy, I have it," he cried one
forenoon, rushing into the ward-room.  "Man, there is
nothing in a' the warld to beat the glorious licht o'
science."
</p>

<p>
"Well, heave round," said Sturdy, lighting a cigar;
"show your glorious 'licht,' as you call it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do that, man.  Listen, Sturdy; listen, my
Lord Tomfoozle, for I'll mak the truth apparent to
even your feckless noddle."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Reikie," drawled Fitzgerald.
</p>

<p>
"Every day, then, the siphon is carried away <i>full</i>.
You've only to put your thumb on it and the thing's
done.  Watch the morn, Sturdy, and you'll put your
thumb on the culprits."
</p>

<p>
And Auld Reikie was right.
</p>

<p>
But the trick was so simple and yet so clever that
the culprits were allowed to escape with only a
nominal punishment.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The bos'n was such a good fellow that no one could
have believed he had an enemy on board.  He was,
however, a strict-service man, and nobody at sea can
do his duty strictly without making at least one foe.
</p>

<p>
It was Christmas time then, and the <i>Gurnet</i> was
still lying at Bombay.  Extra liberty had been
granted to the men, which they did not abuse more
than usual; and as for the officers, many of them
spent nights on shore at entertainments got up in
their behalf by rich European merchants.
</p>

<p>
Jack himself was unusually happy on the Christmas
eve, because only the day before he had received
a whole bundle of letters from home&mdash;from his grandma,
his mother, his sister, big Uncle Tom himself, and
his little cousin Violet, or Tottie as he liked to call
her.  He had received a long, delightful letter also
from Llewellyn.  His regiment, or a part of it, was
then at Fort George.
</p>

<p>
Probably the memory of a long-gone-by Christmas
eve tended to make Jack all the brighter and happier
on this particular night, but certainly he had never
felt brighter or more joyful.
</p>

<p>
The moon was shining brightly on the water as
Dr. Reikie and he came alongside and got quietly on
board, for it was now
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The wee short oor ayont the twal."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They turned in almost immediately, but not before
Jack had knelt beside his chest and prayed for all the
dear ones so far away.
</p>

<p>
It must have been well on towards six bells in the
same watch when the bos'n in his cabin was startled
by hearing his curtain drawn back.
</p>

<p>
There was a feeble light outside, and he could just
make out the figure of a tall man in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?  What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"It's me, sir; it's Jack Bisset, the man you reported
to the commander.  You were quite right, and though
we haven't been friends since, I couldn't sleep to-night
of all nights&mdash;for it is Christmas morning&mdash;till I
came to shake hands and make it up."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Bisset.  Let us be friends.  I bear no
ill-will."
</p>

<p>
He held out his right hand as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
This the sailor grasped tightly with his left, then
aimed a murderous blow at the poor bos'n's skull,
with an iron bar or huge file.
</p>

<p>
The bos'n fell back; and thinking he had done his
murderous work, Bisset dropped the piece of iron and
rushed up the ladder.  He flew past the sentry, and
reaching the forecastle, leaped at once into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Once again the shout of "Man overboard!" rang
fore and aft, and every one was aroused.
</p>

<p>
But the would-be murderer was seen but for a
moment in the moonlight.  He threw up his arms
as if making one last appeal to Heaven, then sank
like a stone.
</p>

<p>
The bos'n was not killed.  The man's blow had
missed the skull, but cut the ear almost off.
</p>

<p>
So ended that tragedy.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
At Bombay one of Dr. Reikie's friends had made
him a present of a photographic apparatus.  This was
a somewhat recent invention in those days, and Auld
Reikie was delighted beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
There would be no end to the scenes he might now
depict.  I believe the possession of that lens and
camera kept him awake for several nights before he
reached Ceylon.
</p>

<p>
There he refused all offers of sport.  Elephant-hunting,
anyhow, was brutally cruel, he said, and he
would find plenty of enjoyment with his camera.
</p>

<p>
The worthy surgeon, on the ship's arrival at
Trincomalee, formed a resolve to astonish his messmates.
He would give them a pleasant surprise.  He had
already taken portraits on glass of the captain
himself, of Sturdy, a group of men, the ship's cat, and
the mongoose.  He should now do something extra
and special.  Well, pleasant surprises are always
welcome, more particularly to officers on foreign
stations.  So Dr. Reikie betook himself to the woods
or bush.  There would be plenty of scope here for
an effective picture&mdash;a lovely bit of scenery, a
treescape, with the sea and ships beyond, perhaps.  The
pictures would aid the advance of science, and prove
even to Gribble, the assistant-paymaster, that
mankind with the sword of knowledge was moving
onwards, ever onwards, conquering and to conquer the
world, ay, and the universe itself.  Mind, he had
told his messmates a thousand times over, was not
matter in motion, as some shallow-minded philosophers
would try to make out.  The soul was as high
above the merely material as Sirius was beyond the
earth.  The mind made use of matter only as a
carpenter made use of a tool.
</p>

<p>
He went on shore, carrying his camera himself.
He would not permit even Jack Mackenzie to
accompany him to-day.  For to-day his pictures would
probably be little more than mere experiments.
Even science must advance by gradual steps and
slow.  When he became a little more expert in the
use of the camera, he&mdash;well, there is no saying what
he might not do.
</p>

<p>
He found at last the spot that suited him&mdash;a
charming bit of scenery: trees, rhododendrons just
bursting into bloom, early though it was, great
masses of dark foliage, the bend of a stream, a
rustic bridge, and a distant mountain peak.  He
felt triumphant already.  How tenderly he handled
his apparatus, how gingerly he set it up, and how
carefully he placed his head and shoulders under
the black cloth!  Yes, there was the picture, upside
down of course, but in colouring complete&mdash;the most
lovely miniature that ever his eyes had beheld.
And yonder&mdash;oh!
</p>

<p>
The "oh" was an expression of pain.  Something
had struck him from behind.  He tore off the black
cloth and looked round, rubbing himself as he did
so.  There was a huge nut lying near him; but who
could have thrown it?  There was no one in sight,
and no nut-tree from which it could have fallen.
It was strange, but he refused to be discouraged,
So he once more enveloped his head in the dark
cloth, when whiz! bump! another and another.  It
was serious; he must be already black and blue.
</p>

<p>
What could it mean?  The place was very
lonesome.  Not a sound was to be heard except the
ripple of the stream and the piping of a bird in a
bush near by.  He was just a trifle superstitious,
and he began to think the wood must be haunted.
He dismissed the idea at once, however, as unworthy
to be harboured by any scientific thinker.
</p>

<p>
To prove to himself that he was not afraid, he
once more hid himself, and began to make sure of
his focus.  He had got it as nearly perfect as
possible, when suddenly the black cloth was seized from
behind and rolled about his head.  He felt a weight
on his back, a cold and tiny hand on the nape of
his neck, and in the struggle to free himself the
tripod got mixed up with his legs, and down he
rolled, camera and all.
</p>
<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-160"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-160.jpg" alt="He felt a weight on his back." />
<br />
He felt a weight on his back.
</p>

<p>
He was white in the face with fear&mdash;yes, there is
no other word for it&mdash;when he at length succeeded
in disentangling himself and getting up.  The matter
was serious.  There were more things in heaven and
earth and the woods of Ceylon than he had dreamt
of in his philosophy.  He determined to retire, and
that right speedily too.  So he bundled his things
up hurriedly.  He would never come here alone
again, he told himself.
</p>

<p>
But the cap of the camera could nowhere be found.
Dr. Reikie was a man of method and regularity, and
he made sure he had laid it down just there.  Well,
it must have been spirited away.
</p>

<p>
He was bending down to pick up a strap, when
crack! upon his bare head came the missing cap.
His astonishment now knew no bounds; but on
looking up, behold an old, very old man with a
long white beard bearing down towards him, staff
in hand, through a neighbouring glade.
</p>

<p>
Was this, then, the evil spirit of the place that
had wrought all the mischief?  Was this&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, sir.  Glad to see you on my domains."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you; but really, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would like to come up to my
bungalow and drink a glass of sherbet.  It is quite
close.  I am a sailor, like yourself, and a naturalist.
I have quite a menagerie up here, and was just
coming to look for two mischievous rascals of
baboons that have escaped."
</p>

<p>
"Baboons!" said the doctor, rubbing himself once
more; "did you say baboons, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! there come the rascals."
</p>

<p>
Next moment two splendid specimens of the agile
gibbon (<i>Hylobates agilis</i>) came bounding from a tree
with screams of delight.
</p>

<p>
"Oo&mdash;ah&mdash;ee!" they cried.
</p>

<p>
They stood nearly four feet high, and their faces
were a study of blended fun and mischief.  Such
droll-looking apes Dr. Reikie had never seen before.
</p>

<p>
He told the stranger all about his adventure, and
as they walked towards the naturalist's bungalow
they had a hearty laugh over it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Starley, as he was called, had a wonderful
collection of curios and pets, and at his house
Dr. Reikie and Jack also became constant visitors all the
time the ship lay here.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
TOM FINCH AND THE SHARK&mdash;SHOOTING IN THE<br />
DISMAL SWAMP&mdash;DEATH AND PROMOTION.
</h3>

<p>
It took the <i>Gurnet</i> a year and a half more to
complete even two-thirds of her circuit, and this
was in reality a voyage round the world of a far
more complete nature than any offered by ocean
racers nowadays, that do little more than touch at a
port, hurry the passengers through the sights, and go
off again.  There is a vast deal of difference, as every
man-o'-war sailor could tell you, between "doing"
the world and "seeing" the world.  Perhaps the best
way to see the world would be to have a yacht of
one's own, and to forget there is any such word as
"time" in the dictionary.  But, alas! few of us are
born with silver spoons in our mouths, so we must be
content to stay at home and read.
</p>

<p>
But the <i>Gurnet</i> sailed for the Chinese seas from
Ceylon, then visited Java, and next straight away for
Australia and New Zealand.  After this she steered
east and by south straight for stormy Cape Horn,
rounding which, amid terrible dangers owing to a gale
that drove her&mdash;after an accident to her machinery&mdash;among
the icebergs, she bore up along the coast
of South America till past Pernambuco, when the
course was changed to north-north-west; and so we
find her at long last safe at anchor at Port Royal,
Jamaica.
</p>

<p>
Except for the breakdown in the machinery off the
Horn, the <i>Gurnet</i> had not met with a single mishap
since she had left the China seas.  All had gone
well.  All hands&mdash;thanks perhaps to Dr. Reikie's care
and attention, and to the first lieutenant's regard for
cleanliness and hygiene&mdash;were happy and healthy.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was now the commencement of what may well
be called an unhappy year for Britain&mdash;1854&mdash;in
which we entered upon the war in the Crimea; a
war which proved, if anything ever did, that Britain's
sons can hold their own, can fight and suffer and die
by the sword or by sickness, no matter how badly
affairs may be managed by those who sit at ease at
home and pull the strings that move great fleets and
armies.
</p>

<p>
But war had not yet been declared; and although
it seemed to be known at headquarters here, in
garrison and on board ship, that it was looming in the
near distance, no one considered that it would be
otherwise than simply an affair of a few months, a
mere military parade and picnic, a little outing for
our troops, with just enough fighting for them and
our blue-jackets to give it zest and flavour.
</p>

<p>
How greatly every one was mistaken events will
show.
</p>

<p>
Things still went on on board the old <i>Gurnet</i>, as
she was now endearingly called, much in the same
way as before.  Dr. Reikie, though never relaxing
his duties on board, nor neglecting a single patient,
however humble, found plenty of time to continue
the pursuit of science, often, it must be confessed,
under the greatest and drollest difficulties.
</p>

<p>
The camera, however, he had given up.  He had
found it unsuitable for his purposes, and so it lay in
the obscurity of a locker beneath his cot.  But just
think for a moment, reader, what a power this
instrument has become in our day, what an aid to
science and art, in war as well as peace, and even
to the advancement of that greatest of all sciences,
though only in its infancy, astronomy!  For by its
assistance myriads of stars beyond the ken of the
most powerful telescopes have been revealed.
</p>

<p>
Well, as the <i>Gurnet</i> must lie here for a few months,
her officers settled down to take things pretty easy,
each according to his own taste or bent.
</p>

<p>
There were excursions to be made by land and by
sea&mdash;these would suit the doctor at all events; there
were parties and balls afloat and ashore&mdash;Jack and
the junior officers, including Gribble the A.P., would
go in for these; and there were whist parties and
dinners, at which both the captain and his first
lieutenant were sure to be present.
</p>

<p>
Jack's great ambition was to catch a shark.
He expected to see them basking in the sunshine
or green transparent sunlit water all around the ship.
</p>

<p>
"In the olden times," he asked Sturdy, who had
been here before, "didn't there used to be a very
large shark borne on the hooks of the flag-ship and
fed with a ration of pork every day, to prevent the
men from swimming on shore?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Sturdy, laughing; "though it wasn't
in my day.  But at the little village of Twyford
in England, in the almshouse, there used to live, and
I think lives till this day, an old sailor who, being
desirous to go a-boozing, as it is called, swam on shore
alongside the shark nearly all the way."
</p>

<p>
"What! and the shark didn't swallow him?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I reckon he didn't, Jack, else he would
hardly be alive to tell the story every Christmas evening."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, how did he manage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, simply enough.  He chose a clear moonlight
night, when you could have seen down to the very
bottom of the harbour.  The sentry was in the know,
though not in the swim.  In fact, Tom Finch promised
to smuggle him off a drop of grog if he turned
his back and kept looking astern while the daring
sailor dropped quietly over the bows.
</p>

<p>
"Tom Finch was a splendid swimmer, and he had
not burdened himself with a superfluity of garments;
but he had three necessaries of life, as he called them:
item&mdash;a pretty-well-lined purse; item&mdash;a big canvas
bag containing pieces of pork for the government
shark; and item&mdash;a big, sharp dagger, with which, he
told his messmates, he would rip that tiger of the seas
open from stem to stern if he didn't play fair."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Jack, "weren't there other sharks about
as well as the tame one?"
</p>

<p>
"He wasn't tame, Jack, by any means; but he was
king of the water, and when he sailed round, all the
others kept at a respectful distance.  So Tom Finch
could have had no better convoy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom struck out.  But he soon found that
this swim of his was going to be no child's play.
The distance hadn't looked very insurmountable from
the fo'c's'le-head, nor was it; but Tom hadn't
considered the tidal current.
</p>

<p>
"He had swum probably fifty yards, when, as
silently as a ghost, there slid up to his very side a
great shark.  Tom could just see it with the tail of his
eye.  Indeed, he says its cold, smooth nose touched the
back of his hand.  At the same moment he made the
horrible discovery that this was not the shark.
</p>

<p>
"Thinking it was all up with him, he was just
about to draw his knife, when dashing through the
water came the ship's shark himself.  There was no
mistaking him.  He made straight for the first comer.
</p>

<p>
"'That's Tom Finch,' he seemed to say.  'He's my
man and my meat, if he's anybody's.'
</p>

<p>
"There was no fight between the two sharks, but
there must have been a long race, for it was some
time before the huge monster returned.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jack," continued Sturdy, "I must tell you
the rest of the story as old Tom Finch himself related
it to the ancient dames in the almshouse not four
years ago.  I must premise, however, that the poor
people are allowed a drop of beer at Christmas, and
Tom Finch had drunk his own and had a sup from
everybody else's mug.
</p>

<p>
"'"An' did the shark come back, Tom?" said old
Sally.
</p>

<p>
"'Ah! that he did, Sally, and I was main glad to
see him too.  There was pork enough in my bag for
him, but not for a score, you know.
</p>

<p>
"'"Good-evening," says Mr. Shark, quite polite
like.  "It is Tom Finch, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"'"That's me," says I.  "I hopes I sees you.  How's
the wife and all the little 'uns?"
</p>

<p>
"'You see, ladies, I wanted to keep him talking as
long as I could, to make the pork last.
</p>

<p>
"'"They're all nicely," he says.  "But now, Tom,
I must do my duty.  I mustn't take the Queen's
bounty for nothing.  I've got to make a meal of
you!"
</p>

<p>
"'"Duty's duty," I replies, swimming as hard as I
knew how to; "and a very toothsome meal I'll make.
But, my dear friend, how would a nice bit of pork do
to begin with?"
</p>

<p>
"'"On with you then," says he, "if you've got it."
</p>

<p>
"'"Lie round on your side then, Mr. Shark, and
open your pretty little mouth."
</p>

<p>
"'Round he lies as docile as a cat, and opens a
mouth as big as the almshouse door there.  I could
have slit him down the stomach then and there; but
Tom Finch never did a mean thing&mdash;thank you,
ladies, I will taste again&mdash;so I just pitched him a
piece of pork, and he caught it like a dog would a
morsel of biscuit.
</p>

<p>
"'Then he winked to me.
</p>

<p>
"'"More!" he cries,
</p>

<p>
"'I flung the other piece as far as I could fling it.
</p>

<p>
"'"Don't do that again, Tom," he says, "else I'll
have to begin at the other end of the banquet."
</p>

<p>
"'My heart began to quake a little now, and the
shore seemed a longer way off than ever.  I tell you
what, ladies, I was getting a bit funky.  But there
was nothing for it but heave another bit o' pork.
</p>

<p>
"'"Are you quite ready?" I cries.
</p>

<p>
"'"Quite ready, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"'"You're sure?"
</p>

<p>
"'The shark lashed the water with his tail, and I
knew he was losing his temper; so I sung out, "Play!"
and threw the pork.
</p>

<p>
"'"More! more! more!"
</p>

<p>
"'La! ladies, I began to sweat with fear.  The pork
wouldn't hold out much longer, and then I knew as
well what would happen, Sally, as I know what's in
your pewter pot&mdash;thanks.  So I threw and threw,
and was soon down to the last morsel.
</p>

<p>
"'"I'm going to give you bag and all this time, Mr. Shark,"
says I; "you'll find the bag toothsome and tasty."
</p>

<p>
"'"Heave away," he cries; and I whips off the bag
and takes out my knife at the same time.  The
struggle would soon begin.  But as good luck would
have it, I now found myself not far off the steps.
</p>

<p>
"'A light glimmered, and a black sentry appeared.
</p>

<p>
"'I threw the bag to my friend the shark.
</p>

<p>
"'"Who goes dere free times?" shouted the sentry.
Bang went the musket immediately.  The bullet tore
up the water; but as the sentry had fired at me, of
course he didn't touch me.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The black sentries on duty at night
in or near the dockyards at
Jamaica had orders to challenge
"Who goes there?" three times, and to
fire in the event of not receiving an answer.
Their plan, however, was
to shout, "Who goes dere free times?" and immediately fire.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'"Good-bye, Tom," says the shark; "I'm off.  Good
luck to you till we meet again!"
</p>

<p>
"'"And may all the bad weather go with you, you
ugly beast," says I.  "But I'm safe now, and hurrah

</p>

<p>
But Jack saw plenty of sharks after a time, and
more than one was captured.  It is about as poor
sport, however, and as cruel as shooting alligators in
the swamps.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
I have now to describe a rather melancholy event
which occurred here at Jamaica on board the <i>Gurnet</i>,
which no one deplored more than Jack Mackenzie,
although it led indirectly to his promotion.
</p>

<p>
We must go back a few weeks in our narrative,
however, to describe how it happened, or rather to
give you, as Dr. Reikie would have said, the primary
cause of the sad affair.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i>, then, had called at Grey Town, Central
America, and had been detained there for about a
fortnight; so to pass the time a picnic and big
pigeon-shoot were determined upon.
</p>

<p>
On the swampy island on which the party landed&mdash;the
party consisting of the A.P. Gribble, the
sub-lieutenant, Dr. Reikie, and Jack himself, with a boat's
crew, and plenty of prog and grog&mdash;there were any
number of pigeons on the trees, and almost an equal
number of alligators in the swamps.  As sly as sin
these horrid brutes looked&mdash;they seemed to watch
every movement of the sportsmen; and slow in movement
though they appeared to be at the edge of the
water, had any one fallen in they would have darted
on him from every point of the compass with lightning
speed, and torn him limb from limb more quickly
than could be described.
</p>

<p>
The gunning went on all the forenoon, and by
mid-day a very big bag had been made.  The exercise, too,
had made the sportsmen hungry; so what more natural
than that they should light a fire and have a good
dinner?  Pork and roasted pigeons go well together,
and neither biscuits, butter, nor the salt had been
forgotten.  The birds were spitted on ramrods and done
to a turn, and all hands admitted it was the best meal
they had eaten since they had left old England.
</p>

<p>
Then all sat round the camp fire smoking and
yarning just as sailors will.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly the sky began to grow dark; the
wind began to moan, and drive the smoke and fire
about.  A brilliant flash of lightning followed, and a
startling peal of thunder.  Then big drops of rain
commenced to fall, and in a minute more a tropical
shower burst over them in all its fury.  Dr. Reikie
was fain to confess that this shower beat all the
showers ever he had known, including even a Scotch
mist.  There was no shelter, and in a few minutes'
time every one was drenched to the skin.
</p>

<p>
Almost as speedily as they had banked up did the
clouds go drifting away seaward, and once again the
sun blazed out with redoubled fury.
</p>

<p>
Now, to permit one's clothes to dry on one's back
in cases of this kind is not the best of policy.  But
what were they to do?  Well, there was only one
alternative, and that was adopted.  They speedily
built up a huge fire therefore, though being wet the
wood took some time to ignite; then they stripped to
the skin, retaining only a kind of kilt or cummerbund
depending from the waist, and while the clothes were
drying they all ran off to the woods and spent the
time in playing at being savages.
</p>

<p>
The result of this shooting expedition in the dismal
swamp was, that in a few days all who had taken
part in it were down with ague.
</p>

<p>
The doctor himself and Jack soon threw off their
attack, but on the arrival of the ship at Port Royal,
both the A.P. and sub-lieutenant had to be sent to
hospital.
</p>

<p>
Gribble got better from the day he entered, but it
was soon apparent to every one that the sub-lieutenant
would not get over it, and one forenoon Dr. Reikie
returned on board with the melancholy intelligence
that the poor fellow was no more.
</p>

<p>
This cast a gloom over the ship&mdash;for all liked the
brave young fellow&mdash;that it took some time to dispel.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow, however, is a plant that thrives but badly
in a climate like that of Jamaica, and I think the
same may be said for other tropical climates&mdash;notably,
perhaps, that of India.  For six weeks I myself lay
ill in Bombay of rheumatic fever, but during all that
time I never had a single fit of depression or lowness
of spirits.
</p>

<p>
Things then soon resumed their usual level on
board the <i>Gurnet</i>.  Gribble came back from hospital;
Mr. Fitzgerald, <i>alias</i> Lord Tomfoozle, was appointed
acting sub-lieutenant; and Jack Mackenzie became
senior, because sole midshipman, of the ship.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
PADDY'S HYBRID&mdash;"A QUARE, QUARE BASTE, SORR"&mdash;TRICKY<br />
NIGGERS&mdash;BLACK MAN AS COOK&mdash;WAR DECLARED.
</h3>

<p>
I think there is no more grateful man than your
honest blue-jacket or marine if he receives a
favour; and Paddy O'Rayne never forgot Dr. Reikie's
kindness to him after that accident of his at
Constantinople, when he went on shore to visit the
"unspakeable Turk."
</p>

<p>
"He might have planked me for it," he told his
messmates more than a dozen times, "and got my
grog and my leave stopped for months, sure.  But
my jewel av a master didn't; and troth it's meself
that lives in the hope of seeing him in the clutches
of the lion or tiger, or drowning in the deep say
before my very eyes, just that I may have the
pleasure of saving his loife entoirely."
</p>

<p>
This might have been, and doubtless was intended
as a good wish; still it was a somewhat strange one.
Only Paddy meant it.
</p>

<p>
And the honest fellow, too, was constantly trying
to do little things to please his master.
</p>

<p>
Knowing the fondness that the doctor had for
getting hold of all kinds of natural history curios,
never a time did Paddy go on shore without bringing
him something.  But most of these were of little use,
and speedily found their way overboard.
</p>

<p>
One day, for example, Paddy came off from shore
in great glee.  He and a messmate had been spending
the day in the woods.
</p>

<p>
"You'll niver guess, sorr, what I've brought you
to-day.  Sure, I'd have caught it alive if I could; but
he wouldn't stop, so I shot it, and I've got it here in
my cap right enough."
</p>

<p>
"And what is it, Paddy?"
</p>

<p>
"It's what they calls a hybrute [hybrid], sorr, and
it's neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring.  It's
got the body of a snake, and two legs like a lizard.
Och, sure, sorr, it's a quare, quare baste indade."
</p>

<p>
"Well, turn it out, Paddy, and don't excite my
curiosity any more."
</p>

<p>
Paddy did as he was told, and carefully opened his
cap on top of the skylight, and out dropped what
certainly looked like a "very quare baste indeed."  It
was getting dusk, so this added to the uncanny
appearance of the creature.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy, Jack, and even Captain Gillespie crowded
round.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" said the latter; "I wouldn't touch it for
the world."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie was delighted.
</p>

<p>
"Paddy," he said, "you're a jewel."
</p>

<p>
"Me mother says the same, sorr."
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the doctor, "I have all along
been a believer in hybrids.  Granted, they may be
accidental, even unnatural.  Nevertheless, here you
have a specimen before you&mdash;a hybrid between the
snake and the lizard.  You see the long body; you
see the legs near the creature's shoulder&mdash;two legs
only.  Dissection may probably reveal two rudimentary
limbs farther aft.  This specimen, gentlemen,
shall grace the museum at Edinburgh, and I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here he picked the creature up by the tail, when, lo
and behold, out tumbled a frog from the mouth of a
snake.  The latter had swallowed the frog, all but the
hind quarters.  Everybody roared with laughter, and
the doctor's face grew a fathom long, more or less.
The frog was alive, and rubbing one of its eyes; the
snake was dead: but the doctor was never allowed to
forget his hybrid.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Having in a former book described the scenery, the
tree-scapes, and mountains and glens in Jamaica, and
the beautiful ocean around&mdash;beautiful even in the
grandeur of its storms&mdash;I have no desire to repeat,
but I must say that Jack Mackenzie lost no
opportunity of going on shore with Dr. Reikie.  A day
with him in the woods and wilds, if it were merely
bird, beetle, or butterfly hunting, was a picnic never
to be forgotten; and our young hero learned something
every time, and was soon convinced that natural
history is the most pleasant of all earthly studies.
Nor did a day spent on shore ever pass without some
little adventure or other worth remembering.  Many
of these were rather comical than otherwise.
</p>

<p>
During their escapades inland the two friends saw
a good deal of black men's life.  Dr. Reikie found
some of these fellows handy in carrying specimens;
they also acted as guides when the two explorers
went far inland.  As regards the ethics of these men,
I think they were what the doctor called them&mdash;"honest
with good looking after."
</p>

<p>
They were fond of "a dram," too, and would drink
the white Jamaica rum fresh and hot from the stills.
It used to make their eyes start almost out of their
sockets.  They liked it for that very reason.  But
Dr. Reikie had on board a dram, which he gave them
when they helped him off with his curios, that they
liked even better than this&mdash;namely, what is called
"Cape smoke," about the strongest and vilest spirit
there is.  The surgeon found it handy for keeping
small specimens in.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, dat is good, massa," a nigger would say as
soon as he had recovered his breath after swallowing
half a tumblerful neat&mdash;"dat is good; it makes me say 'Huh!'"
</p>

<p>
Fond of a good joke some of those niggers were,
too.  They seemed to know that man-o'-war sailors
will eat almost anything.
</p>

<p>
One day when the cotton was in "pod" some niggers
enticed a party of blue-jackets into a plantation.
</p>

<p>
"Dere is some bery good pea to eat heah, gentlemans,"
they said.
</p>

<p>
The jackie-tars did not require a second invitation,
but began tearing the "pods" open.  When, however,
they got the fluff among their teeth, and the niggers
began to laugh, they soon desisted, and the darkies
had to fly.
</p>

<p>
Was it love of fun or love for cash, I wonder, that
was to account for the following?  The John Crow or
Turkey buzzard (<i>Vultur aura</i>) is, like all his race, one
of the most filthy and disgusting of birds.  But one
day, as an Irish merchant skipper was about to sail, a
nigger boarded him.
</p>

<p>
"I sellee you cheap," he said, "some bery good turkey."
</p>

<p>
The head of this horrid buzzard, I should tell you,
is very like that of the turkey, and the nigger had
plucked the bodies.
</p>

<p>
After attempting to beat the man down in his
price for a minute or two, the skipper bought these
"turkeys," and the nigger came on shore chuckling to
himself.
</p>

<p>
What the end of the story was I cannot say, but I
should have liked to see that skipper's face when the
buzzards were cooked and served up.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In his pursuit of science&mdash;as usual under
difficulties&mdash;Dr. Reikie and his young friend Jack went once
upon a cruise among some small tropical islands.  They
took with them a nigger who assured them he was an
excellent cook.
</p>

<p>
They took the man on his own recommendation.
On the first day this black cook presented them with
an excellent fry of sea-gull and pork.  I suppose the
nigger must have skinned the gulls, for if not so
treated they are apt to taste somewhat peculiar.
</p>

<p>
On the second day they returned to the beach,
where they had pitched their little camp, hungrier
than on the previous evening.  The doctor had been
successful in making a capital bag, and securing
many specimens that he believed, when placed in
Edinburgh Museum, would hand down his name to
posterity.  They were looking forward, therefore, to
a good feed.
</p>

<p>
Sambo met them.  He was grinning good-naturedly
from ear to ear.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, massa," he cried, "you hab one bery good dinnah to-day."
</p>

<p>
So it was served.  You will believe me it was a
failure when I inform you that Sambo had made a
kind of Irish stew of sea-gulls, pork, fish, and roots
all boiled up together!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Just one other example of negro cookery and negro
innocence.
</p>

<p>
In the grounds of Jamaica hospital there were
some fine tamarind trees, in which the very smallest
known species of humming-bird used to build its
nest and rear its tiny young.  I do not say it
was not cruel of Dr. Reikie to shoot these birds,
but he wanted some specimens very much.  But
the smallest shot blew the birds to the back of
the north wind apparently, and the doctor was in despair.
</p>

<p>
Paddy O'Rayne stood by him.  Paddy was scratching
his poll in a considering kind of way.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got an idea, Paddy?" said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Indade and I have, sorr.  If ye want to kill the
burds, sorr, widout injuring them at all, troth it's a
pinch of gunpowder and a thrifle of sago you must be
after using."
</p>

<p>
Paddy was right for once.  But now came a new
difficulty.  How should he preserve the lovely
creatures?  They were far too tiny to skin.  He got
over this by simply wrapping them in brown paper,
and drying or desiccating them on the hob of the
hospital kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Well, one day he gave three nicely-shot and
beautiful specimens to the nigger cook to do for
him.  What were his surprise and disgust to have
them brought to him by the black fellow on a plate!
</p>

<p>
"Him done now, massa," he said.
</p>

<p>
Yes, indeed, they were done, for he had removed
the paper and cooked them, feathers and all.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There is a species of dove or pigeon out in Jamaica
that the niggers themselves consider rather delicate
eating, or at all events are very fond of.  It (<i>Zenaida
amabilis</i>) suffers much from the biting of mosquitoes.
Well, the niggers know this, and so they make a fire
under a tree and heap green wood thereon to make
a smoke.  This drives the insects off; and well the
doves know it does, for they soon come and settle on
the tree, preferring the smoke to the mosquito bites.
But, alas! they are out of the frying-pan into the
fire, as they speedily fall victims to the guns of the
niggers.
</p>

<p>
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But cases of cholera were getting rife, and so the
<i>Gurnet</i> was ordered to sea at last.  She now bore up
for the lone Bermudas, a group of islands that lie
many degrees to the north and east of the West Indies.
</p>

<p>
The Bermudas are said to be the loveliest islands
on this earth.  They are certainly very beautiful;
but, strange to say, one always seems to think every
group of tropical islands he comes to, while sailing
here and there across the ocean, more lovely and
fairy-like than the last.  The words of the poet rise
to my mind, however, as I think of Bermuda:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Where the remote Bermudas ride<br />
  In the ocean's bosom unespied,<br />
  From a small boat that rowed along,<br />
  The listening winds received this song,&mdash;<br />
  'What should we do but sing His praise<br />
  That led us through the watery maze<br />
  Unto an isle so long unknown,<br />
  And yet far kinder than our own?'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There are more than a hundred islands here, great
and small; but at the time of the visit thereto of
the <i>Gurnet</i>, probably not more than a dozen were
inhabited.
</p>

<p>
Steam was up in the ship when she first sighted
lights, about four bells in the middle watch; and
owing to the number of rocks and shoals about,
it was deemed advisable to keep well off until
morning.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie and Jack were both on deck early, and
the scene that met their view seemed like one of
enchantment.  Some of those verdant isles seemed
to be floating in the clouds.  But dark rocks were
seen here and there like the backs of monster whales,
and over these the sea-green water broke and moaned
and boomed in long lines of snow-white surf.  Farther
off to the right and left the ocean was basking in the
sunlight, a deep and cerulean blue, with here and
there a patch of opal or green where the coral or
weedy bottom showed through.
</p>

<p>
"Man," said Dr. Reikie, "isn't it fine?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is charming!" cried Jack, with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"And," added the doctor, "if we only stay here
for a month, let alone two, as Captain Gillespie
expects, the Edinburgh Museum will hardly be able to
docket all my specimens."
</p>

<p>
"But see, on the flag-staff on the fort yonder they
are making signals," said Jack Mackenzie.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Jack; but no' to us.  They're speaking to
that wee vision of a gunboat far away yonder.  I
guess they'll talk to us presently."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
For once in a way Dr. Reikie was disappointed,
and the Edinburgh Museum must have been a very
great loser indeed.  For when Captain Gillespie
returned from the flag-ship, the news he brought was
very exciting indeed, not to say startling.
</p>

<p>
War had been declared against Russia, and the
very gunboat they had seen had orders for the
<i>Gurnet</i>&mdash;which her commander (a lieutenant he
was) had not expected to meet here&mdash;to proceed
eastwards with all speed, and wait further orders
at Gibraltar.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
"BLOW, GOOD WIND, AND WAFT US EAST."
</h3>

<p>
War, war, war!  Yes; war was the cry,
from Land's End to John o' Groat's.  In
England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, war, war, war!
In the drawing-rooms of the wealthy, in the humblest
cottar's hut far away on Highland hillsides, you
heard that song; it was sung by prince and peer and
peasant, in theatre and concert and gutter.  And
even in churches, bishops, in their sleeves of lawn,
prayed to Heaven to bless our arms, and for the
"God of battle" to fight on our behalf.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Britain was valiant, Britain was brave in those
days, just as she would be were war to be declared
to-morrow against any nation, no matter which.
</p>

<p>
And we were in the right, too.  So everybody
believed, so everybody said.
</p>

<p>
Turkey, for this once at all events, was a poor,
down-trodden country; Russia the cowardly, Russia
the aggressive and grasping, had her heel upon her
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Russia!"  Yes, there were many who made
use of those two little words, and spoke them with a
sneer.  Holy, indeed!  Was she not the vilest, the
most ignorant and tyrannical nation on earth&mdash;a
nation of slaves and serfs domineered over by an
emperor who, if he could find no one else to trample
under foot, would make war upon his own people,
would throw them into prison if they but dared to
call their heads their own; who tore the newly-married
wife from the arms of her husband, lacerated
her tender flesh with the knout, and sent her in
chains to die amidst the snows of Siberia?
</p>

<p>
Holy Russia, indeed!  Nay, but Russia the despot.
Every portion of her bygone history was raked up
to help to fill the bill against her&mdash;so far, that is, as
Britons knew anything about it; all that poets told
us about poor Poland for instance, and sang to us
about Warsaw's last champion; all about Ivan the
Terrible, and goodness knows what else.  And Russia
was the same now&mdash;just as cruel, just as dark-hearted,
as blood-thirsty, and tyrannical as ever.  Down with
her!  Back with her to her own Siberian wilds!
Crush her, annihilate her!
</p>

<p>
Yes, certainly; and after we had done all this we
should return thanks to Him who had given us the
victory&mdash;feast and <i>fête</i> our brave soldiers and sailors,
or what remained of them&mdash;make a kind of a Christmas-time
of it, even though it should be midsummer,
and eat and drink until we should be ill.  Hurrah
for war!
</p>

<p>
But was Russia wholly to blame for the sad
Crimean War?  And was Russia really so bad as
she was called?  Did we not rather jump to the
conclusion that this great kingdom was all vile and
evil, just because we knew nothing at all about it?
When I say "we," I of course refer to the ordinary
British public.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, be it remembered, dear reader, what
with school boards, county councils, extra newspapers,
and so on and so forth, the public is becoming more
enlightened; and if we were going to war now, the
people would probably ask their leaders, political and
otherwise, what the quarrel was about, and why
they were ordered to peel off their spare clothes and
go for the enemy pell-mell.  And their leaders would
feel it incumbent upon them to supply the desired
information&mdash;that is to say, if they themselves knew
anything about it.  But in old Crimean times the
people were more easily pleased, and took everything
for granted that was told them.  They were led by
the nose, not by the intellect.  If you had asked any
body of British workmen in those days why the
country was going to war, their answer would have
been, "'Cause we are.  The Russians want whopping&mdash;the
papers all say so&mdash;and we're going to whop
them."
</p>

<p>
Then if you had said, "But what have they
done? what have they done?" the workmen would have
repeated, "Why, what is it they haven't done?  What
is it they ain't always a-doing of?  Just read the
Parleymintary reports for yourself.  Is it likely we
would go to war if we didn't oughter to?  Anyhow
we're goin' to fight.  Fetch 'em out.  Hurray!"
</p>

<p>
I am told&mdash;though personally I was but a boy
then&mdash;that the ignorance displayed in what is called
society, or the "upper circles," was about on a par
with that of the British workman concerning the
causes that led to the war, and that even some
so-called statesmen were densely ignorant on this
subject.  They had to read up quite a deal before they
dare submit themselves to a "heckling" at dinner-parties
or over the walnuts and the wine.
</p>

<p>
Over the walnuts and wine, indeed, some of those
great statesmen were less nervous, and could speak
more freely, knowing from their own experience that
very little of what was said would be remembered
next day.
</p>

<p>
And now&mdash;although I should be very sorry indeed
to hamper this story of mine by talking politics&mdash;it
will do you, reader, no harm to know that at this
time the Russian peasant or artisan in town or
country was&mdash;and probably is even yet&mdash;an ignorant,
good-natured, frequently drink-besotted, credulous,
hard-working "sumph," with a good deal of
poetry and romance in his nature, nevertheless, and
not a little real piety.  He lived, perhaps, very much
the same sort of life as our own peasantry did before
the days of education dawned and the press began
to guide and sway public opinion.  Next to things
heavenly, this people considered it their duty to obey
the behests of their emperor and those in authority
above them.  When I add that ignorance caused
them to have just the same erroneous impressions of
us as we had of them, I think I have said enough
to bring the quality of the Russian peasant before
your mind's eye.  It was from his ranks that the
soldiery were drawn; only after they joined their
regiments they were led to believe that Britain was
a nation of savages, and that the true faith was not
in it; rather, indeed, would its people trample on the
most holy things, murder priests at their altars, and
desecrate and burn temples and shrines.  The Russian
soldier, if he thought at all, looked upon his country
as a kind of Holy Land, and he himself as a soldier
of the Faith and of the Cross.
</p>

<p>
Well, my own opinion is that the next best thing
to fighting an enemy is to respect him, and I am
quite sure that if we&mdash;the Russians and the
British&mdash;had known more of each other in those old days,
we would have loved each other a little more, even
while cutting each other's throats.  This reads a
little paradoxical, does it not?  But if my theory is
carried a little further, how then?  Why, we should
have no bloody wars at all.  For the more nations
know each other, the more they sympathize with
each other; sympathy makes us charitable, even to
our neighbours' shortcomings; sympathy begets love,
and love makes us sheathe the sword: so war becomes
impossible.  It is love of this kind that is to lead
the millennium in; but knowledge has got to go
before&mdash;we must not forget that.
</p>

<p>
"I say, sir," said Jack Mackenzie to Mr. Sturdy one
night, as they sat together on the skylight, while the
good ship <i>Gurnet</i> was speeding onwards and eastwards
over the Atlantic, with every stitch of canvas
drawing that she could bear, and stun'-sails alow and
aloft,&mdash;"I say, sir, what is our immediate cause of
quarrel with Russia?"
</p>

<p>
"A very pretty question, Jack; a parson couldn't
have put it in better English.  But really, lad, a
parson might be a fitter man to answer it than a
rough sailor like me.  Seems to me, however, and
from what I learned on board the <i>Limpet</i>, that Russia
thinks it is high time to reform Turkey."
</p>

<p>
"To reform her with the sword?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, lad&mdash;the old fashion.  To improve the
greatest portion of her off the face of the earth, and
to sweep all the Turks who won't turn Christian
back into the land of heathendom&mdash;that is, clean out
of Europe into Asia."
</p>

<p>
"Seems very mindful of Russia, doesn't it, sir?
And if successful, does she expect no reward?"
</p>

<p>
"Reward? why, yes; and a proud reward too.
She, and she alone, is to rule where Turkey now
rules; to have complete possession of the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles&mdash;take a look at your map, lad,
when you go below&mdash;and thus have the freedom of
the Mediterranean, and a sea-board on the warmer
and sunnier southern climes.  No wonder that such
a prospect dazzles the Czar, and even his people.
</p>

<p>
"And no more fitting time, he believes, could be
than the present, Jack.  Russia, you see, is trying
her hand at the construction of a new map of
Europe.  It would be a very handy map for the Czar,
but a very expensive one for other Powers.  If we&mdash;the
British, for instance&mdash;desired to hold our own,
to keep Malta, Alexandria, or to open up a near
route to our possessions in India, we should have
then to maintain a fleet in the Mediterranean at least
three times as large as it now is.  But France, to
say nothing of Prussia and Italy, has also interests to
protect.  It would suit neither to see Russia acquiring
a splendid new capital&mdash;namely, Constantinople&mdash;and
therefore holding the key of the Mediterranean."
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!" said Jack.  "Of course I don't know
enough to argue on either side.  But, sir, doesn't it
seem a little rough on Russia to be locked up in the
icy north, and to have no outlet to the southern seas?"
</p>

<p>
"She might have, lad&mdash;she might have, if she
could be trusted.  But she won't play fair.  She
wants to eat all the pie, and give nobody else a plum.
As for Austria, if Russia gets hold on Turkey, she
gets command of the Danube at the same time, and
would in time, no doubt, turn that country, <i>nolens
volens</i>, into a province of her own."
</p>

<p>
"The Russians must be very ambitious and aspiring."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and now the Czar, having, as he thinks, made
a friend of the youthful or boyish Emperor of Austria,
believes the time has come for a <i>coup de main</i>.  Well,
Jack, if one man desires to pick a quarrel with another,
and to hit him across the bows, some excuse very
soon presents itself.  And so war between these two
countries&mdash;Turkey and Russia&mdash;has been hinged upon
some dispute concerning the holy places of Palestine."
</p>

<p>
"Holy Russia!" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Russia may be right enough, Jack, as far as
the innocent people are concerned; but I believe the
Emperor Nicholas to be a sly, underhand dog.  The
dispute was of a very simple nature, lad.  There are in
Palestine a Greek Church and a Latin Church.  Russia
is champion of the Greek, France favours the Latin
Church, and the question came to be which of these
should hold the key of the Church of Bethlehem; and
the Turks, in trying to please both Powers, so offended
Holy Russia that she sent south two great army corps
to the Danubian Principalities, and at the same time
dispatched Prince Menschikoff as an envoy to Constantinople
to intimidate, if not to coerce, the Sultan."
</p>

<p>
"And what did the Sultan do? bastinado the Prince?"
</p>

<p>
"That might certainly have precipitated matters.
But the Turks are an indolent, easy-minded kind of
a people, who fight well, but only when forced; so
they caved in, as we call it."
</p>

<p>
"Acceded to Russia's demands?"
</p>

<p>
"That's better English.  But listen, lad.  The Czar,
seeing now that he couldn't get ends to meet in one
way, tried another.  There are a very large number
of Christians in Turkey, and over these the Emperor
of all the Russias next demanded a complete protectorate!
</p>

<p>
"It was the delusion, Jack, therefore, that we did
not see through his ultimate designs, and that the
British lion was harnessed to the plough-stilts, and
never likely to lift an angry paw, which led the Czar
to be so threatening towards Turkey as to cause that
country to declare war against Russia, which she did
on the twenty-third of October 1853.  The next
thing that happened was that, with the view of
protecting their interests, France and Britain sent
their combined fleets off to the Bosphorus.
</p>

<p>
"'If,' thought the Czar to himself, 'we can get
Britain to keep quiet, we may snap our fingers at the
other Powers, and crush Turkey up like an empty
egg-shell.  And John Bull is far too busy attending
to trade and making money to bother about the
Ottoman Empire.  If John Bull does, why, I can
suggest his having Egypt and Candia.'
</p>

<p>
"The despatch of the fleets to the Bosphorus was
not a declaration of war, but a kind of a display of
physique under the title of moral suasion, just as
when two men peel to fight, Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile, you see the people of our isle have
been watching the manoeuvres of the big bully.  To
begin with, they didn't like the insolent arrogance of
Menschikoff in Constantinople; but when news came
that the Russians, with six line-o'-battle ships, had
attacked a squadron of light Turkish vessels at
anchor in the harbour of Sinope in the Black Sea, and
utterly destroyed them and their crews&mdash;a holocaust,
my boy, of between 4,000 and 5,000 men&mdash;then
Britain cried 'Shame!"'
</p>

<p>
"It was time," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and we now brought our moral suasion to
bear even on the boy Kaiser of Austria.  Russia must
evacuate the Danubian Principalities.  This demand
was made by united Britain and France in February
of this year, Jack (1854).  At this time it was
supposed that the war would be one on the Danube.
But the Kaiser moved 50,000 men up to the frontier,
which the Czar had seized&mdash;showing plainly that she
means to join the scrimmage if need be.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack, of course we can't tell what is doing
now out there, but very likely they are all at it
hammer and tongs, for in March the French and
British declared war."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible, isn't it, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, in a manner of speaking," said bold
Sturdy; "only, you see, war means promotion for you
and me.  As far as I am concerned, lad, promotion
has been a jolly long time of coming, and I'm not
going to say a word against the war now that I see
my captaincy heaving in sight above the horizon,
Meanwhile, Jack&mdash;blow, good wind, and waft us east;
for whatever happens, I should, I must confess, like
to see a little of the fighting and a bit of the fun."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Sturdy was in all respects a true sailor,
and a warrior at that.  It is, indeed, a blessing for
our country that our navy&mdash;which is still the best in
the world, though far inferior, indeed, to what it ought
to be&mdash;is manned by thousands of hearts as brave
as his.
</p>

<p>
Fear the British sailor does not know&mdash;even death
has few terrors for him; because Jack is really a
thinking man, and he counts his chances, and he
knows, too, that he has only once to die.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, can he die better than with cutlass or
rifle in hand, fighting for his dearly-beloved country,
either afloat or ashore?
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the <i>Gurnet</i> speeds on, and so do events
in the East.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the first plan of campaign
that the Russians had laid down for themselves, quite
relying upon the acquiescence of Austria, I pray you
to take a glance at the skeleton map of the Black Sea
and its surroundings.
</p>

<p>
When I was a youngster myself I did not like
maps, and remembering this, I have placed neither
town, river, bay, nor cape that is unnecessary in this
present map of mine, specially made for you, reader.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-201"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-201.jpg" alt="Map of Black Sea and surroundings" />
</p>

<p>
Well, you will easily find out Sinope, where the
Russians massacred the Turkish sailors.  I want you
to remember that their fleet had sallied forth from
Sebastopol for this purpose.  Now, note the river
Danube.  It was by this route that the Russians had
meant to make their advance against Turkey.  Further
south you will observe Silistria and Shumla, and south
still the Balkan Mountains.  It was through the
passes of these that the Russians were to extend their
march, and so on to Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
Our army and that of the French were therefore
at first landed at Varna, and went into camp between
that place and Shumla.  It was believed at this time
that the Russians would fight us here by land.
</p>

<p>
But after having laid siege to Silistria, which the
Turks bravely defended, and being hard pressed by
Austria, who seemed now determined to join the allied
armies and declare war, the Czar withdrew his forces
and recrossed the frontier.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that Russia had counted all along upon
the friendship, or at least the neutrality, of Austria.
As soon as the Russians had left the Principalities,
the territory was occupied by the Austrians.  They
certainly had the most interest in the threatened
invasion and conquest of Turkey by the Czar, and it is
believed that even at this late date the whole
business might have been settled without war, and that
Russia could have been compelled, from the pressure
put upon her, to indemnify Turkey for the injuries
done her.
</p>

<p>
But Britain had not the slightest intention of so
inglorious an ending to the great "weapon-show" she
had commenced.  Were our splendid troops, eager
and burning for fight, to return to their own country
and homes, with, figuratively speaking, their fingers
in their mouths, and without having once drawn a
trigger?  Perish the thought!
</p>

<p>
The Russian Bear must be crushed and humbled,
his fleet in the Black Sea must be destroyed, and
Sebastopol, Russia's strongest fortress in this sea, laid
in ashes.
</p>

<p>
War! war! war!
</p>

<p>
When I come to think of it now, reader, I don't
altogether blame the people of Great Britain for
desiring to humble the overbearing Emperor Nicholas.
Even the <i>Queen</i> herself saw that he was in the wrong,
and talked of the ambition and selfishness of one man
and his immediate subordinates as being the cause of
our having to draw the sword.  On the other hand, I
do not think that any one who has read the history of
this great war could help pitying the Czar's subjects.
The poet Cowper says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "War's a game which, were their subjects wise,<br />
  Kings would not play at."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the sufferings of our own poor soldiers and
sailors, all brought on by mismanagement, strike closer
home to our hearts.  We can pity these still more,
while we cannot but be angry with those who were to
account for all their misery, and for all the trials they
so bravely bore.
</p>

<p>
We gained experience in the Crimea, however, and
one might almost say that this is cheap at any price.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
A GHASTLY ADVENTURE&mdash;THE EMBARKATION&mdash;A<br />
STORMY LANDING.
</h3>

<p>
As soon as it was known in Britain that the
Russians had retreated from the Danube, and
that their forces would in all likelihood be poured
into the Crimea to reinforce that great stronghold,
every scrap of news from the seat of war was welcomed
with the greatest enthusiasm.  Every one, too,
seemed to be listening breathlessly and in silence for
the first shot to be fired.  It was a silence, all made
sure, that would soon be broken by the pæans of
victory.  Our soldiers near Varna were not idle.
True, they were waiting for embarkation, and what
a wearisome wait it was!  It would have been
irksome in the extreme had our troops not been
kept busy collecting wood and manufacturing gabions
and bastions for the siege-works before Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
Even already, then, it will be noted that a siege
was in contemplation.  Nobody, however, had any
idea it would be a long one.  The allied fleets
had complete possession of the Black Sea.  In a
manner of speaking, Sebastopol was already besieged
or blockaded.  Our object was, or rather ought to
have been, to isolate the Crimea from Russia.  (<a href="#img-201"><i>Vide</i>
map</a>.)  Seeing that the neck of land that joins it
to the mainland is of no great width, this ought to
have presented but few difficulties.  We should thus
have effectually prevented enforcements from pouring
into Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
But difficulties arose long before the allies were
ready for embarkation that no one had dreamt of.
While the French troops were still on their voyage
from Marseilles, some cases of that terrible disease
the cholera had broken out among the troops.  The
doctors made as light of it as they could, assuring
those in command that, as soon as the army had
landed and commenced active service, the plague
would be stayed.
</p>

<p>
This was very far indeed from being the case.
The cholera grew even more virulent after the men
got under canvas.  Here was an enemy, then, that
seemed to fight on the side of "Holy Russia," and
that, too, with terrible effect; for before the
embarkation for the Crimea, the French army had about
10,000 dead or hors de combat, while nearly a
thousand of our own brave soldiers had succumbed.
The fleet, too, was attacked, and steamed away to
sea in the hopes of safety.  In vain.  It was a
terrible time on board some of our vessels; for the
virulence of the plague seemed to know neither
bounds nor limits, and the healthy part of the crews
was engaged all day ministering to the sick, laying
out the dead, or committing their bodies to the deep.
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that one beautiful morning&mdash;the
sunshine glittering on the sea and casting a
glamour over the greenery of hill and dale and
woodland&mdash;our old friend the <i>Gurnet</i> steamed into the
Bay of Balchik, some distance north of Varna.
Embarkation was here busily going on, amidst a scene
of such confusion and bustle as no one on board the
<i>Gurnet</i> had ever before witnessed.  The bay was
covered with ships of every size and description&mdash;an
immense forest of masts bearing flags of all kinds and
colours, conspicuous among which were the British,
French, and Turkish ensigns.  In and out among the
shipping plied the boats, with which the bay was so
filled that scarcely could the water be seen.  The
noise and din were indescribable.
</p>

<p>
Well, if the embarkation of our troops was not
conducted in so orderly a manner as one could wish
to see, that of the French and Turks was confusion
worse confounded.
</p>

<p>
Early that morning, before the <i>Gurnet</i> got in, and
ere yet the grey clouds of the dawning day had
changed to purple and gold, Jack Mackenzie, whose
watch it was, had gone to the first lieutenant's cabin
to make a report.
</p>

<p>
"Three men, sir," he said, "are swimming about
a quarter of a mile off our weather-bow."
</p>

<p>
"What do they look like?" asked Sturdy.
</p>

<p>
"I can't quite make out, sir.  Perhaps they are
the survivors from some boat that has been capsized."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Jack; lower the first whaler."
</p>

<p>
"Can I go myself, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  The quartermaster is on deck?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> was hove to, and in a short time,
rowed by its brawny crew, and steered by Jack
himself, the whaler was bounding over the waves
towards the men.  Yes, men they had been; but
now, horrible to relate, they were but hideous,
grinning corpses.  Buried they had been&mdash;that is, buried
at sea, and hastily, too, with shot to sink them; but
this had not been sufficient.  It was a ghastly
sight.  The men lay on their oars for a time looking
horrified.  Silent, too, for a time, till one old sailor
spoke out.
</p>

<p>
"Them's cholera corpses, sir.  Hadn't we better
put back?"
</p>

<p>
Jack had really been wondering whether it was not
his duty to take them in tow, so that they might be
properly buried.  A cold shudder ran through him,
however, when he learned the truth; and so the boat
was put about and rowed swiftly back to the ship.
</p>

<p>
"I thought as much," said Sturdy, when Jack went
below again to report.  "Ah, lad! if the cholera has
broken out among our troops and seamen, we'll be
held in check by an enemy far more terrible than the
Russians."
</p>

<p>
That evening Dr. Reikie and Jack went on shore
to pay a visit to the camp of the Highlanders under
the brave Sir Colin Campbell, who, years after this,
became the hero of India during the awful mutiny.
Everywhere they were met by troops on the march
towards the hastily-constructed piers that our
engineers had made to assist the embarkation.  Slowly
and sadly these troops marched; so weak and sickly
did they appear, that scarce could they carry their
knapsacks.  It was but little wonder.  The whole
air had the odour of a charnel-house.
</p>

<p>
They found their way to the Highlanders' camp
at last; and rushing out from his tent-door, the first
to bid Jack welcome was his cousin Llewellyn.  He
had just come off duty, and had not had time to
divest himself of his accoutrements.
</p>

<p>
"Duty," he said, smiling a little sadly; "why,
Jack, it's all duty just at present.  It is duty all
day long and most of the night, and I'm never out
of my war-paint.  But perhaps our brave fellows
have suffered as little as any from the scourge, though
we have buried quite a number.  At first, Jack, we
used to play them to the grave with the 'Dead
March,' you know.  But la! lad, there is no music
now.&mdash;Dr. Reikie, I have heard so much about you
from Cousin Jack's letters that I appear to have
known you all my life.  But, bless me, boys, come
under canvas.  I and Lieutenant Murray are quartered
here.  Snug enough?  Oh yes; we don't complain
about anything but the delay in getting off.  We want
to fight.  Oh, I feel sure when we get into grips with
the Russians the cholera will be scared away."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said Reikie; "but I very much
doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, don't frighten us, anyhow," said
Llewellyn.
</p>

<p>
That bold young Highlander certainly did not look
as if anything would frighten him.  How handsome
and strong he was, and how brave he seemed!  I'm
not at all sure that Jack did not envy him his
superior stature&mdash;for he bordered on six feet.
Perhaps Jack was boy enough yet to covet that feather
bonnet, for he was barely seventeen.
</p>

<p>
But Llewellyn threw off his Highland bonnet, and
ordered his servant to bustle about and get coffee ready.
</p>

<p>
It is no wonder that the conversation turned upon
home.  But at this stage of the happy meeting it
hardly could be called a conversation; for Llewellyn
had so much to say that in telling the news his
tongue could scarcely rattle on fast enough.  But
the gist of what he said can, after all, be given in
a few words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Three years and over, Jack, since you were
home.  Never mind, lad; we've only got to smash
the Russians, to raze to earth the battlements of
Sebastopol, to annihilate the defenders, to hurl back
the Bear to his icy den in the north, and, having
covered ourselves with honour and glory, to return,
as the good ships' parsons tell us, 'in safety to enjoy
the blessings of the land with the fruits of our
labours.'"
</p>

<p>
"Loot, eh?" said Dr. Reikie, quietly smiling; "and
we have to thrash the Russians first?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes; that is part of the programme of this
grand picnic."
</p>

<p>
"And mother and sister?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Both happy and beautiful.  And what think you,
Jack?  I went down to say good-bye, of course,
before my regiment left, and Uncle Tom, who has
all sorts of kindly messages to you, went with me,
and your sister told me that she is coming out, if
the war lasts over the autumn, to help to nurse
the sick and wounded!  A whole lot of ladies are
coming, only I don't expect there will be any sick
or wounded left to nurse by the time they think
of coming out.  Well, then, north I went to bonnie
Drumglen, where my sister Tottie is at present, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"My little sweetheart?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes: the old lady won't want her, and indeed
we are all so happy to be friends again.  As she
gets older, Jack, she gets more forgiving and less
severely aristocratic.  Oh, she has a heart after all.
She had tears in her eyes, Jack, when she bade me
good-bye, loading me with tender messages to her
own dear boy, as she still calls you."
</p>

<p>
"God bless her!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Jack, and Uncle Tom and I went to see the
Malonies.  Poor Peter is just the same, only he no
longer plays on the street, for, through uncle's
influence, he has adopted teaching music as a profession.
The Malonies haven't altered a bit, and your old cat
is still first favourite at the fireside.  And
Mrs. Malony told me tell you she prayed for you every
morning and night of her life, and made Malony himself
do the same under penalty of feeling the weight
of the potato-masher in case of forgetting."
</p>

<p>
It was late that night before the doctor and Jack
got back to the <i>Gurnet</i>; but nevertheless they found
everything on board in an uproar, preparations being
made to receive for passage a contingent of one of the
regiments.
</p>

<p>
Storm and tempest delayed the sailing of the
great armada for some time after it was quite ready.
But at last it got to sea; and when once fairly away
from the bay, and bearing up for the unknown land,
then as Jack and Sturdy stood side by side on the
quarter-deck, the brave lieutenant confessed that never in
all his experience had he beheld so grand a spectacle.
</p>

<p>
The whole peninsula of the Crimea is hardly twice
the size of Aberdeenshire or Yorks; and broadening
out from the Isthmus of Perekop in the north, its
whole length to Balaklava in the south (<a href="#img-265"><i>vide</i> map</a>)
is not more than 120 miles as the crow flies.  The
entire population of the Crimean peninsula at the
time of the invasion is said to have numbered about
220,000.  But looking at a map, although it gives
one a good idea of the lie of the land and water,
is not very instructive as far as the features of the
country are concerned; so, just in a sentence or two,
let me tell you what these are like.  The northern
and the middle portions, then, are a kind of barren
prairie land or steppes, and but sparsely inhabited by
Tartars, who dwell in tumble-down little villages, and
tend their flocks and herds.  Not so peacefully,
however, as do our Highland shepherds.  Those Tartars
may be simple in their ways, but they are wild and
uncouth in nature.  But proceeding southward from
Perekop, we come to a far more beautiful or bountiful
land.  Mountains shelter it from the storms of the
north, and here are hills and glens and wide smiling
valleys with woods of pine and oak, under the shelter
of which, and on the sunny braes, grow olive trees,
the pomegranate, and even sub-tropical fruits, while
green grass waves plentiful in spring and summer,
and wild flowers are everywhere.
</p>

<p>
The southern end of this peninsula is hilly and
cliffy.  It is indented on the west by the great
harbour of Sebastopol, and on the south by that of
Balaklava.  The capital is Simferopol, lying away to
the north and east of the virtual capital, Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
It was on the north and west of the peninsula
that the allied armies landed and commenced their
memorable march upon the great Russian stronghold.
In the map you will note the streams or rivers they
had to cross.  The first is the Bulganak, and is but a
"drumlie" rivulet or burn.  The hills that range here
with valleys between are from 400 to 500 feet high.
</p>

<p>
Well, the Bulganak flows west, so does the Alma
seven miles further on, and also the Katcha and
Belbek, the latter being nearest to Sebastopol.  But the
Tchernaya, I wish you to observe, runs north and
west, and falls into the head of the harbour of the
great stronghold.
</p>

<p>
There is but one other point I wish to draw your
attention to, and that is what is called the Upland
between Sebastopol and Balaklava.  The extreme
western point is called Cape Kherson.
</p>

<p>
The distance from Varna to Sebastopol is about
300 miles, and had this city been made, in every
sense of the word, a base of supplies, much of the
suffering during the terrible winter of 1854-55 would
have been spared our ill-starred soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The coast had been well reconnoitred by H.M.S. <i>Caradoc</i>
and <i>Agamemnon</i>, on board of which were
not only Lord Raglan himself, the one-armed hero
and commander of the British forces, but General
Canrobert and Sir John Burgoyne.
</p>

<p>
At last the beach to the north of Bulganak was
selected as a landing-place, owing to its position;
being defended inland by two small lakes, so that the
enemy, had they wished to attack, could only have
done so by the narrow strip of beach betwixt these
lakes and the sea.
</p>

<p>
The French and Turks were first got on shore on
the fourteenth day of September; and they landed
unopposed by the enemy, but not by the elements,
for a heavy swell tumbled roaring in upon the beach,
and the surf and breakers were so high that boats
and rafts were dashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Had a terrible gale from the west come on, this
allied fleet might have suffered as disastrous a fate as
the Spanish Armada of olden times.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th the British landed.
</p>

<p>
How small in comparison with the forces and huge
armies of the present day was the whole combined
force!  The Turks numbered but 7,000&mdash;they had
sixty-eight guns, but no cavalry; the French were
infantry, 28,000 in all; and we ourselves had but
26,000, added to which was that brave and splendid
Light Brigade of cavalry 1,000 strong.  Ah! we shall
hear of them again.
</p>

<p>
The knapsacks of our brave fellows were left
on board, for many were so low and ill that they
could not have carried them.  Nothing, indeed,
was carried that could be dispensed with&mdash;not
even tents, bar those for the sick and for the head
officers.  Blankets to cover them they had, and in
these were wrapped up only the bare necessaries
of life.
</p>

<p>
Nor was there any available transport landed save
a few horses.  The army, however, soon captured
country carts from the Tartars to the number of
about 400, and they drove in all the live stock that
they could find.
</p>

<p>
But on the whole, instead of being prepared for a
long and exhausting war, our soldiers stood on the
beach hardly equipped for a review or picnic.
</p>

<p>
Providence probably fought on our side, else the
Russians, who had a free hand and a very large force
of cavalry, might have terribly harassed us and
rendered our victories impossible.  The whole army
of the allies was, be it remembered, a "movable
column."  It had no base behind it to which it could
send back its sick or wounded.  These must be carried
onwards day after day, or left to the tender mercies
of a foe that, under the circumstances, one cannot
marvel at being implacable.  Moreover, a movable
line of battle must hurry on to death or victory; for
if it be harassed by the enemy's cavalry, and by
guerilla bands of the peasantry, and people whose
country is invaded, the limited supplies are soon
exhausted, and there is nothing to fall back upon.
</p>

<p>
The march of the allied armies, then, onwards to
Sebastopol, a distance of about twenty-five miles, was
indeed a daring and adventuresome one.  But the
many hopes of the invading army lay in at once
inflicting upon the Russians a defeat that should
stagger and paralyze their whole force.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the nineteenth of September,
our forces in battle array reached the first of the
streams, the Bulganak, and here, for sake of water,
they bivouacked for the night.
</p>

<p>
It might have been said that the whole force slept
upon their arms; for on the hills, at no great distance
beyond them, the Russians were espied, apparently
about 10,000 strong in all, and well supplied with
horses and artillery.
</p>

<p>
But the night passed quietly by.  The hour of
battle had not yet arrived.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
A FIELD OF HEROES&mdash;"ON, LADS, ON!"&mdash;BRAVE<br />
CODRINGTON&mdash;PANIC AND TERROR.
</h3>

<p>
It was nearly ten o'clock next day when the allies
again moved forward.
</p>

<p>
Every heart beat high as the order was given to
advance, for it was known all along the line that the
day of battle had dawned.  Yes, every heart beat
high; but long ere eventide many of those brave
fellows would be lying still and stark on the bare
hillsides.
</p>

<p>
The enemy had indeed withdrawn from the ridges
in front; but no one doubted that he lay further on
awaiting the attack, and on ground that had been
carefully selected.
</p>

<p>
On and on and on they marched, tired enough
already, many faint and obliged to fall out.
</p>

<p>
In the regiment of brave Highlanders, the 93rd,
in which Llewellyn Morgan held his commission, every
man seemed burning for the fray.  The certainty of
battle had raised their spirits, and even those among
them that but the day before had felt weak and
sickly, now marched on with heads erect.  Llewellyn
was certain in his own mind that, were it not for the
fact that they had to keep in alignment with the
vast army which stretched from their right away
towards the sea, the Highlanders would soon have
been far in advance.
</p>

<p>
It was not, however, until nearly noon that the
sound of great guns came booming towards them
from the west.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it, Grant?" said Llewellyn
to a lieutenant who marched by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Grant, "those are the guns of the allied
fleet.  They have found the enemy on the heights
beyond the river Alma, and have opened fire.  How
do you feel, Morgan?" he added.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn smiled.  "Well," replied the brave young
fellow, "I cannot say that I feel afraid; but I suppose
what I do feel is something very like it.  I am burning
with anxiety, and now and then my heart goes
pit-a-pat."
</p>

<p>
Grant laughed.  "You are very candid," he said;
"and your feelings are just mine.  Confound those
French fellows! why don't they come on?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a short while ago they had to halt for us.
Come, Grant, time about is fair play."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, halt the beggars did to make their coffee.
But now when we get to the top of this grassy slope
we shall see the river Alma, and see the enemy also."
</p>

<p>
And this was so.
</p>

<p>
I wish, reader, we could remain with bold young
Llewellyn and his friend Grant throughout all the
fearful battle of Alma.  But we must take a glance
at the whole field.
</p>

<p>
The plain on which the allies made their last halt
swept smooth and green down to the winding river
side.  (<a href="#img-222"><i>Vide</i> plan.</a>)
</p>

<p>
If a small boat at sea were sailing north from the
direction of Sebastopol, she would find on her right
a high wall of rugged rocks.  Well, on coming to
and entering the river, these cliffs are still continued
up the south side of the stream for a mile and a
half.  After this the wall of rocks ends in a range
of hills or heights, subsides into these, as it were, and
the braes are now climbable even to Englishmen, and
far more so, of course, to the Scottish mountaineers.
</p>

<p>
Now for the villages on the northern bank of the
stream.  The first is Alma Tamak, higher up is
Bourliouk, and higher up still the little village of
Tarkhanlar.  As to the roads leading up through
the cliffs or up the hills, the first is near to the
mouth of the stream, which is here fordable, and
the path goes up the cliff.  At Alma Tamak there
is, when you get over the river, a road up a kind
of glen in the wall of rocks, and along this guns
may be taken with difficulty.  Further up still, and
near to a farm, is a third road; then a better and
wider one not far from Bourliouk, which takes the
traveller right away up to Telegraph Hill.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-222"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-222.jpg" alt="Map of Heights of Alma" />
</p>

<p>
Having ascended the wall of rocks through the
gaps, or climbed the braelands, our troops would
find themselves on a rugged tableland which stretched
south and away as far as the next river&mdash;Katcha&mdash;which,
with Belbek, lay between them and the goal
of their expectations, Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
The disposition of the forces is plainly laid down
in the plan herewith presented, so I need not describe
it in the text.  As to the fleets, the Turkish squadron
was farthest south, then came the French, and next
the British.
</p>

<p>
It will be noticed that the whole front of battle
fell to the share of the British, the French having
undertaken to reach the heights between the enemy
and the sea, and so turn the Russian left flank.  But
the main portion of the enemy's forces was massed
to the east of the road from Eupatoria to Sebastopol.
Observe, please, their batteries, their cavalry stretching
along from Kourgané Hill, and note the position
of the Vladimir Regiment.  When you have done so,
we are ready for the great fight.
</p>

<p>
Lord Raglan himself, in company with brave St. Arnaud,
reconnoitred the enemy's position during the
last halt, and after that, towards one o'clock, the
signal for battle was given.  We must follow the
French, for they had the honour of commencing this
bloody affray.
</p>

<p>
General Bosquet's division, then, which had been
hugging the sea-shore, was divided into two brigades.
One of these was ordered to leave their knapsacks
behind&mdash;alas! many a poor fellow never saw knapsack
more&mdash;and, fording the stream, ascend the first
path I have mentioned.  This brigade was followed
by the Turks.  The other brigade ascended opposite
Alma Tamak, and the artillery were taken up this
road also.  Farther inland, General Canrobert's division
got on by the road opposite the farm, and, next
to Canrobert's, Prince Napoleon's division.
</p>

<p>
But note this early: that the seaside brigade of
Bosquet's and the Turks never got near enough to
the enemy to fire a shot.  So that disposes of them.
Indeed, if you imagine the field of Alma to be a
chess-board, you can suppose this brigade and the
Turks as useless.
</p>

<p>
Canrobert's guns had to follow Bosquet's left
brigade a mile to the west of him, and he himself was
a mile to the west of Telegraph Hill.
</p>

<br />
He has seized the colours, and his wild slogan can<br />
be heard high above the roar.
</p>

<p>
Well, now, many of my readers will at once ask
the question: Why didn't the Russian general destroy,
block up, or defend these roads?  Perhaps he
forbore to defend them because he would have placed
himself within reach of the ships' guns; but a little
engineering skill might have rendered them entirely
impassable, to artillery at all events.
</p>

<p>
While the French were ascending to the right
then, even as it was, the guns of their fleet were
throwing their shot and shell far on to the plateau
beyond them.
</p>

<p>
And now the British began to move onwards to
take up the ground they were to occupy.  There
were, therefore, confronting our British soldiers at
least 21,000 men, with eighty-four guns on
hastily-constructed batteries.
</p>

<p>
I should be sorry to ask the reader to burden his
memory unnecessarily; but as the Second Division
and Light Division took such a prominent part in
the battle, it is well to remember of what regiments
they were made up.
</p>

<p>
The Second Division, then, which was on the right,
with the Light on the left, was composed of the 30th,
55th, and 95th regiments, under Pennefather; and
the 41st, 47th, and 49th, under Adams.  It was
commanded by Sir De Lacy Evans, who was a true
hero and a good soldier.  He had fought in the
Peninsula, in America, and at Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
The Light Division (Sir George Brown's) had also
six regiments&mdash;the 7th, 23rd, and 33rd, under brave
Codrington; and the 19th, 77th, and 88th, under
Buller.
</p>

<p>
Between the villages of Bourliouk and Tarkhanlar
were many enclosed gardens, their stone walls running
towards the river.  Many of these were all a-tangle
with vines.  Right opposite, on the other side of the
river, was the famous Kourgané Hill, and its batteries
some distance back.
</p>

<p>
Our skirmishers, going on at the double, first
encountered the Russian fire from the village of Bourliouk
and those vineyards; but the enemy was driven from
there after setting fire to the little town, the flames
and smoke of which added much to the terrible
character of the scene.  Our Light and Second Divisions
began to deploy as the shot and shell from the
Kourgané battery tore through their ranks and burst
over them.  There was here another delay, owing, I
believe, to our right being too close to and hampered
by the French.
</p>

<p>
This delay, it is said, was not accidental but part
of the plan, and our divisions were waiting to let the
French artillery get up by the road I have already
mentioned.  For Canrobert's infantry and Prince
Napoleon's division could not advance without the
support of its guns.
</p>

<p>
Soon, however, and before the proper time, a staff
officer rode from the French commander asking Lord
Raglan to push on.
</p>

<p>
Then, indeed, the tug of war began in deadly
earnest; for the order to advance was given, and on
dashed our troops.
</p>

<p>
About the same time Lord Raglan, singularly
enough, with a few of his staff, rode round the right
of the village, crossed the Alma, and stationed
himself on a height well within the enemy's lines, from
which, while he could observe what was going on, he
could scarcely be expected to issue orders.  Moreover,
he was in a position of danger.  This certainly
proved him a brave man, but was not quite in
accordance with the tactics of the best generals.
</p>

<p>
But come, reader, you and I shall, for a time, join
Brown's command on the left, for it is the first to
advance; and like Llewellyn yonder with his
Highlanders, we are burning to fight.  He, however, has
not the chance afforded him yet.  We have, so hurrah!
</p>

<p>
Here we are at the first low wall, which we leap
nimbly, and find ourselves among the tanglement of
bushes and vines.  We must cut and fight our way
through these till we reach the river.  Did ever you
pause on the banks of a stream and wonder whether
it was fordable or not, or whether it would be
unadvisable to wet your feet!  Whiz!  That was a
round shot, that flew close over us; and shells are
now tearing up the vineyard behind us, and shattering
the stone walls.  The bullets from above are
pattering on the water, and men are falling here and
there.  So we hesitate not, but dash into the stream.
The swords of our brave young officers are pointing
onwards.  Yonder is the hill.  Up we must charge!
</p>

<p>
Now over the stream, we find a little shelter, for a
few moments only, under the opposite bank.  Some
of us, weak from illness, are already pumped.  All
are glad to have this breathing spell.  We look back
across the stream.  Yonder is the blazing village,
flames leaping in tongues high in air through the
clouds of smoke and sparks that roll slowly to
leeward.  Evans's men, their belts and accoutrements
glittering here and there in the sunshine, are half
hidden by the smoke, but soon they too reach the
stream and commence to ford.
</p>

<p>
"On, lads, on!"
</p>

<p>
It is the bold voice of Sir George Brown, who, on
horseback, is the first to clamber up the bank.  We
draw a deep breath, and nerve ourselves to follow.
Nay, but it needs but little power of will to get up
nerve.  Are we not Englishmen?
</p>

<p>
So we answer our general with a blood-rousing cheer.
</p>

<p>
We are up!  The fight is raging now all around
us.  Last night, as we lay under the stars wrapped
in our humble blankets, we wondered if in the heat
of battle we should experience aught of fear.  Fear? no,
no, here is none of it.  We hardly know just at
present what is going on.  We hear no orders.  The
din of battle&mdash;the shouts of rage or agony, the clash
of arms, and the roar of artillery&mdash;deafens us.  The
air is filled with smoke and flame.  At times we are
in touch with our companies, and charging two deep
against the four-deep masses of the grey-clad foe in
front of us; but as often as not do we find ourselves
in no line at all, only fighting in daring groups.
We in the Light Division, though at present we know
it not, are supported by the 95th, one of Codrington's
regiments.
</p>

<p>
This is awful work!  Not three hundred yards
ahead and above, the shot from the Russians' greatest
battery is tearing through our ranks.  Again and
again we stumble, sometimes on the blood-slippery
glacis, sometimes over a fallen friend.  Yet on we
dash towards the fiery mouths of those roaring guns.
Away to our right the 7th Regiment is hurling all
its force against the left wing of the Kazan Regiment.
That was indeed a terrible tulzie!
</p>

<p>
Hurrah!  It is a wilder shout than ever.  Just for
a moment we see the impetuous Codrington urging
his regiment even to greater speed.  It was their
war-cry we heard, and it steels our every nerve.
</p>

<p>
But see, the guns above us give no longer voice.
Have we won?  We know not.  The guns, however,
are rapidly being withdrawn.  And we know afterwards
that a greater mistake could not have been
made by our surly foe.  Yet every gun is valuable,
and I suppose they knew we would take them
anyhow.
</p>

<p>
But bravery is not everything in battle.  The
guns, it is true, hurl no more their deadly missiles,
to decimate our ranks, but there are now rushing on
to meet our four regiments the brave Vladimir Regiment,
supported by a field battery, and another great
regiment, with the right wing of the Kazan.
</p>

<p>
Can we stand it?  Our men are falling on every
side&mdash;officers, sword in hand, sergeants, rank and
file, piled here and there, or crawling in agony and
writhing in anguish and pain.
</p>

<p>
How hot the fire! how wild the din!  We are
being annihilated.  Where are our supports, and
why do they not make haste to help us?  We
know not.  We do not know that the Guards are
even then hurrying up to our support.  Yet
Codrington seems to have done about all a brave man
could do.
</p>

<p>
He is outnumbered&mdash;beaten and flying.  Ah! there
was no fear before, but now as we are hurled down
the hills, something more than fear, and akin to the
nightmare terror that seizes a runaway horse, fills
our breast, and it is <i>sauve qui peut</i>.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes more and our supports would have
been on the field of battle.
</p>

<p>
There come the Guards.  They have advanced in
good order.  They have forded the stream, and are
bravely rushing on up the hill thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>Left Battalion.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Centre Battalion.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Right Battalion.</i><br />
  THE COLDSTREAMS. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOTS FUSILIERS. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; GRENADIERS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, what happens?  Alas! our broken and
retreating ranks sweep down on that centre battalion,
and carry it right before us to the banks of the
stream.
</p>

<p>
Are we beaten?  Is the battle lost?  These questions
we may put to ourselves, even to each other,
but we cannot answer.
</p>

<p>
Personally&mdash;that is, as far as our four regiments
are concerned, to say nothing of the Scots Fusiliers
that were hurled back by us&mdash;we are defeated.  There
is no other name for it.
</p>

<p>
Our losses, though we are ignorant of this at present,
are fifty commissioned officers, about the same
number of sergeants, not including twelve officers of
the daring 7th.  In rank and file altogether over one
thousand men lie dead or wounded.
</p>

<p>
But see, although the Scots Fusiliers are swept
down by our pell-mell retreat, the Coldstreams and
Grenadiers continue their advance in splendid lines
and quite unbroken.
</p>

<p>
Ah! there is something in bravery and daring that
at times leads on to victory against odds too fearful
for the mere tactician to contemplate.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE KILTED WARRIORS OF THE NORTH&mdash;THE TERRIBLE<br />
STRUGGLE FOR KOURGANÉ HILL&mdash;THE IMPETUOUS<br />
93RD&mdash;VICTORY!<br />
</h3>

<p>
At this stage of the battle all our available forces
were being hurried into action.
</p>

<p>
The three regiments that had remained with Evans
were terribly cut up in attempting to hurl back the
Russian infantry, supported by batteries that disputed
possession of the post-road.
</p>

<p>
The 41st and 49th were advancing towards the
eminence on which Lord Raglan and his staff were
situated; while the Third Division, under General
England, with six regiments and two field batteries,
was crossing the Alma to their support.
</p>

<p>
But we must leave General Codrington doing his
best to rally his regiments and form another division
to advance, while we seek adventure farther to the
left.  Not, however, till I tell you one incident of
this heroic fight.  As I have already said, then, the
centre battalion of the Guards&mdash;namely, the Scots
Fusiliers&mdash;was hurled back with Codrington's beaten
men, and with, alas! a loss to the Scots of Lord
Clinton and three sergeants killed, ten officers and
thirteen sergeants wounded, and 154 rank and file
lying dead or wounded on the brae side.  This left
a gap between the Grenadiers and the Coldstreams.
Well, having got together some of his brigade,
Codrington sent forward to ask Colonel Hood of the
Grenadiers if he should place his newly-formed men
between the two battalions to fill up this gap.
</p>

<p>
One cannot help feeling for Codrington, for the
answer from Hood was a snappish one.  "No;
certainly not," he said.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Hood, with his now-open left bravely
advancing to the attack, was in reality disobeying the
last order he had received.  This was that he should
conform to any movement on his left.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" he exclaimed, when the centre battalion
was swept down the hill, "the movement on my
left is defeat and retreat.  Am I to conform to <i>that</i>?
I'll be hanged if I do.  On, men.  Forward!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven!" he afterwards said, "I disobeyed
orders."
</p>

<p>
So might our sailor-hero Nelson have said, for he
disobeyed orders, and put the glass to his blind eye.
</p>

<p>
Let Hood continue to advance with his Grenadiers;
and the cool, courageous, precise Coldstreams go
onwards too.  Both have deadly work before them.
</p>

<p>
But here we are among the Highlanders; and is
it not true what Scott says?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ne'er in battle-field throbbed heart more brave<br />
  Than that which beats beneath the Scottish plaid."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And now they were going into action&mdash;to do or to
die.  Yes, to do or to die.  They have never been
in battle before&mdash;that is, in a real fight like this.
But it never occurred to them that they might or
could be beaten.  They were nearly all young soldiers
those kilted warriors of the north&mdash;of the 42nd
or Black Watch, the 93rd or Sutherland Highlanders,
and the 79th or Camerons.  Most of them spoke their
native Doric, broad and harsh, yet kindly even in the
ear of an Englishman, or the Gaelic; and many of
them had left the plough-stilts or the flail, to flail
the Russians in another fashion, with that bravest of
soldier-Scots, Sir Colin Campbell, at their head.
</p>

<p>
These men were strong and tough as the heather
on their native hills, lithesome too, swinging in step,
and with no end of courage, go, and stay.
</p>

<p>
No wonder that Campbell was proud of his Highlanders
on this day of all days; and it was a leader
like him they needed, and nothing else, to take them
straight forward into the cauldron of fire and death.
</p>

<p>
But not only was Campbell proud of them, but the
whole army also, just as they were of the Guards.
</p>

<p>
It will be observed, too, that theirs was the most
select situation in the battle&mdash;that is, as a brave soldier
would select it.  For what more likely than that the
Russians should mass on their own right, and with
cavalry, infantry, and artillery attempt, when opportunity
offered, to turn the left of our whole formation.
</p>

<p>
"Now, lads," cries Campbell, waving his sword,
"up and at them."
</p>

<p>
And on we dash towards the hills.  We, you and
I, reader, are attached to the 93rd.  Our three
regiments find it not easy to get through the rough
ground and over the river.
</p>

<p>
We are across now, though.  Our formation is
figured below.  It is in <i>échelon</i>, the 42nd leading.

We pass the 88th, who are in square, as if expecting
a charge of cavalry; also the 77th, in line.
Both are falling back.
</p>

<p>
Sir Colin cannot restrain his indignation at what
he looks upon as arrant cowardice.  His Scotch blood
leaps in all his veins, and he shouts something like a
command to the 88th to form line and advance.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Scotties," cries some one in the square.
"You can do the work."
</p>

<p>
Sir Colin and his regiments do rush on.
</p>

<p>
The hero of the day soon has the 42nd in alignment
with, and in advance of, the Guards.  Our regiment
and the Camerons, still in echelon, are rapidly
hurrying up.
</p>

<p>
The left of the Coldstreams have their staff officers
near to where the grenadier company of the 42nd
now are, with Sir Colin at their head.
</p>

<p>
Down below the hill the discomfited regiments
that Codrington is getting into order again are firing
at random, up hill, on the redoubt.
</p>

<p>
It is the most critical part of the battle.  In fact,
since the Highlanders and Guards began to climb the
heights we may call it a new battle.
</p>

<p>
Something tells us that we will not be beaten this
time, but that we may leave our bodies on the field.
See, yonder is brave and stalwart young Llewellyn.
The ensign-bearer has fallen, but he has seized the
colours; and his wild slogan can be heard high above
the roar of battle as he urges us on.  How gallant
he looks!  No wonder we follow.
</p>

<p>
But it is just at this moment that Sir Colin hears
the voice of some staff officer of the Coldstreams
advising the retreat of that fine regiment.  The odds,
he thought, were far too great.
</p>

<p>
"The brigade of the Guards," he cried, "will be cut
to pieces.  They should retire and recover their
formation."
</p>

<p>
Then comes Sir Colin's answer, uttered in the
wildness of angry passion, and sounding far and near
over the field.  "Better, sir," he shouts, "that every
soldier in Her Majesty's Guards should lie dead upon
the field, than that they should for a single moment
turn their backs upon the foe!"
</p>

<p>
There is an answering cheer.
</p>

<p>
That brave voice seems to turn the whole tide of battle.
</p>

<p>
Then Sir Colin speaks to H.R.H. the Duke of
Cambridge.  "I counsel your Grace," he said, "to go
straight on with the Guards.  I will move up with
the 42nd and turn the redoubt."
</p>

<p>
And up we go.
</p>

<p>
From the bridge over the Alma, for about a mile
and a half, there now stretched all along that thin
red line of mostly two deep that so astonished the
Russians and eventually led to victory.
</p>

<p>
Where all fought so well it is almost unfair to say
which was the bravest part of the line.  But the
Russians fought like furies, too; markedly the
Vladimir and Kazan columns, with which our Guards had
most to do in this second struggle for Kourgané Hill
and victory.  But you and I, reader, are with the
Highlanders, and we want no braver companions.
</p>

<p>
See, Sir Colin rides forward quickly and alone to
reconnoitre.  Terrible seems the odds against him.
He is upon a ridge abreast of the now empty redoubt,
from which the enemy had fled.  Bullets whiz and
ping around him.  Twice is his horse struck, but falls
not.  He quickly takes in the situation, and is in a
position to lead his troops to the best advantage up
that formidable hill.
</p>

<p>
It is to the Black Watch that Sir Colin shouts,
"We'll have nane but Highland bonnets here."  We
of the 93rd are more impetuous.  Wildly so.  Hark
how our slogans ring over the field!  We feel nothing
but a burning desire to be breast to breast with the foe.
</p>

<p>
And yet the odds is terrible.
</p>

<p>
With three battalions Sir Colin is to meet and fight
no less than twelve.  Our battalions, however, are in
line; those of the enemy are massed together in five
columns.  We are Highlanders; they are Russians.
No, no; we do not despise our enemies, they are men
of solid, ay and stolid courage, but&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The 42nd he allowed to attack two columns by
itself, unaided; in the hollow, too, betwixt him and
the hill, he himself being at its head.
</p>

<p>
It is a critical moment now, for a column of Russians
of great strength comes marching on, evidently
with the intention to attack the 42nd's flank.  Then
just as he is preparing to receive it with a front of
five companies, the 93rd come wildly charging to
the crest.  This is a regiment of regiments in the
Crimea, filled with dare-devils from regiments left
at home, who desire to see war and fighting at its
best or worst.  It is under the fire of the advancing
column.  Hardly is it dressed up, hardly in formation;
and hence the danger.  It may hurl itself on
this steady, strong column, and literally be dashed to
pieces like a ship that strikes a rock.  Sir Colin is
quick to see the peril, and gallops on towards us.  His
voice can check an assault as surely as it can lead
one, so perfect is the trust his Highlanders put in
him; and so the regiment soon recovers its disordered
formation, and once more moves on.
</p>

<p>
Colin's horse is again shot now, and gently slides
down beneath him&mdash;dead.  Poor horse!  But once
more our hero is mounted.
</p>

<p>
Onwards and onwards we advance, vomiting forth
fire and smoke.  Our great stature, our determined
visages, our kilts and waving plumes, we learn
afterwards from the wounded Russians, struck a strange
terror to their inmost hearts.  The two regiments
effect this; but when still another&mdash;the 79th&mdash;comes
bounding onwards, the columns of the enemy give
way, and all along the hillsides rise our cheers of
victory, mingled with the wailing of the defeated foe.
The Ouglitz battalions are still to be defeated.  But
once more the Highland brigade&mdash;one and all of us&mdash;being
re-formed, pours in its volleys, and the Ouglitz
column is forced to flee.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Our victory was most complete, though our losses
had everywhere been very great&mdash;that is, on the side
of the British; the French suffered nothing in
comparison with what we did.
</p>

<p>
Brave Sir Colin was everything to his men and
officers.  Indeed they fought as if the great master's
eye was ever on them, and it is true that few acts of
heroism escaped his notice.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn's heart was filled therefore with a pride
that positively brought tears to his eyes, when his
chief complimented him on his valour.
</p>

<p>
"But," added Sir Colin with a kindly smile, as he
placed his hand on the young soldier's shoulder, "one
must always in battle be calm as well as brave, and
at one time to-day I really thought my gallant boys
of the 93rd had lost their heads."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Victory!  Yes, a glorious victory!  When the news
came to England, and to Scotland, Ireland, and Wales&mdash;for
did we not all take our share in this memorable
battle?&mdash;people went positively daft with joy.  Yet I
fear there was a good deal of braggadocio mixed up
with the general rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
The bells were set a-ringing; there were more balls
and parties over it than if it had been Christmas, and
thanksgiving was heard in every pulpit throughout the land.
</p>

<p>
But those who had sons, brothers, husbands, or
fathers at the far-off war, went in anxious suspense
for the account of the killed and wounded.  And
sorrow came at last, and there was weeping and wailing
in many a family.
</p>

<p>
Well, the glory that Alma brought us was "real
real," as a Yankee would say.  I do not know exactly
what the weight of glory is, nor am I acquainted with
its exact value per square inch.  Anyhow in this case
the French praised us, and we patted and praised the
French, while even the Russians allowed they had
been fairly beaten&mdash;by force of numbers.
</p>

<p>
Had the Russians, however, defended the roads and
passes, or obliterated them; had they used their
cavalry and reserves, and not pulled away their guns,
it is evident that our victory would have been a far
more costly one to us, even if it had not ended in
disaster.
</p>

<p>
At the time that Codrington's beaten regiments
swept their supports&mdash;the Fusiliers&mdash;down the hill,
it was touch and go.
</p>

<p>
Had not Colin Campbell with his brigade of heroes
come in the nick of time, defeat, it seems to me, would
have been ours.
</p>

<p>
If the Russians made mistakes, so did we.  For
there was an utter absence of concerted action, no
unity of purpose, nor were the regiments in action
supported as they should have been.
</p>

<p>
Ah! we shall hug the glory of Alma to our hearts
all our lives nevertheless; for our gallant fellows&mdash;English,
Irish, and Welsh, as well as Scots&mdash;were, in
a manner of speaking, Johnnie Raws (I say it in no
disrespectful way)&mdash;good soldiers, and clever in peace
and on parade.  But we had not been to war for
forty years before, so I think we did very well,
considering everything.
</p>

<p>
And to tell you the truth, reader mine, whenever I
go along the Strand, or enter a club room, or pass the
door of a great book emporium, or even clothier's
shop, and see a straight, sturdy, grey-haired commissionnaire
with a silver medal and a clasp or two on his
breast bearing the sacred names of Alma, Inkermann,
Balaklava, I feel very much inclined to lift my hat
to him.  Don't you?

CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
A WALK ACROSS THE BATTLE-FIELD&mdash;GHASTLY<br />
SIGHTS&mdash;BRAVE SURGEON THOMPSON OF THE<br />
44TH&mdash;JACK'S STRANGE ADVENTURE.<br />
</h3>

<p>
So much for the glory of war; how about its
ghastliness?
</p>

<p>
Ah! well, the glory, I suppose, is abiding; the
ghastliness is soon hidden in the grave.
</p>

<p>
But oh, reader mine, is it not dreadful to read that
on the very night that followed the battle men were
sickening and dying with cholera in numbers as great
as before?
</p>

<p>
It is no wonder, methinks, that as I write that
sentence, tears that I fain would repress make dim the
lines before me.  Because I know something of the
horror that cholera brings in its train, and the agony,
despair, and suffering&mdash;a suffering so great that many
times and oft the surgeon breathes a prayer of thankfulness
to Heaven when his patient's eyes are closed in
death.  And, horrible to relate, even after death
cramps and spasms sometimes come on, so that the
ignorant would believe that the subject had once more
come to life.
</p>

<p>
We naval and army surgeons are called non-combatant
officers.  Heaven help us! we have as
many dangers, in ship or field, to encounter, as the
men who, sword in hand, march at the head of their
companies; and when the field is won our work is
only beginning.  And they, the so-called combatants,
get nearly all the glory.
</p>

<p>
After the battle of Alma, fain would some of the
generals have had their troops come down and bivouac
beside the river, for sake of the water.  But that
plucky old soldier Raglan must have them sleep on
the heights, in the field they had covered with
glory&mdash;and dead.
</p>

<p>
The men were for the most part tired to excess,
war-worn, and thirsty, yet seeming to want sleep
more even than water, which they felt too far gone
to drag uphill.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn and Grant had escaped without injury,
and together, in the cool of the evening, they strolled
down to the river's bank.  As far as the stripping of
the wounded (which takes place after European battles
by the ghastly hordes that hover in the rear intent on
plunder) was concerned, it was conspicuous only by its
absence.  But here was a sight that caused the blood
of those two young men almost to curdle with horror.
</p>

<p>
There were many men lying, or even sitting, dead,
in the very position they had assumed just before the
messenger of death came singing towards them.  Many
were lying on their backs, with arms upstretched as
if appealing to Heaven for help or mercy.  Llewellyn
and his friend were standing near a corpse which lay
in this position, with the musket across the chest,
when their own surgeon came up.
</p>

<p>
"No," said the latter, with a sad kind of smile;
"that man passed away painlessly, and at once.  His
arms are but outstretched as if still holding his gun."
</p>

<p>
Here was a headless trunk.  Blood and brains had
been spattered over the clothes and faces of other men
who also had been killed.  Here a dead body, with
both legs torn off and flung to a distance.  Here
another, with one arm lying by its side, broken
perhaps; the other, but a shattered and bloody stump,
held aloft.  Both eyes were open, and the face had a
scared and awful look.
</p>

<p>
But for one dead man that Llewellyn saw there were
at least a dozen wounded, and those for the most part
lay sick and uncomplaining, as still almost as the
dead.  Or they would simply try to raise themselves
on their arms and plead for a little water; sometimes
the words would be but a whisper.  Even as they did
so it was no uncommon thing to note a spasm of
agony come over the face, and a jerk to one side, then
hands that drooped and eyes half shut, and gradually
the placidity of death.
</p>

<p>
There were some wounded men dying even as the
doctor bent over them.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn tried to raise one poor fellow, whose whole
shoulder had been torn away by part of a shell, and
who seemed struggling to sit.
</p>

<p>
"Can I do anything for you?" said the young officer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes: tell her to come, and bring baby.  I want
to see baby.  Where is the light?"
</p>

<p>
Ah! indeed, where was the light?  His head
drooped like a wounded bird's, the spirit fled, and
Llewellyn laid him gently back.
</p>

<p>
Some of the faces of the wounded were so disfigured,
so shot away I might call it, that they were
fearful to behold.  Some, they said, had scarcely
mouths to eat or drink with, the lower jaws being
carried clean away.  Faces these were to live in one's
dreams for ever and aye.
</p>

<p>
But enough of this picture&mdash;enough of the ghastliness of war.
</p>

<p>
The allied armies, who, some say, might have
marched directly into Sebastopol on the day after
their great victory, did not resume their advance until
the 23rd.
</p>

<p>
The wounded of the enemy had at first been in
great distress, and when our army went on, Dr. Thompson,
assistant-surgeon of the 44th, volunteered
to stay behind and look after them.  And his
servant, M'Grath, stayed also.
</p>

<p>
Thus was this brave fellow left behind in an
enemy's country with 500 wounded Russians.  An
act like this surely speaks for itself, and tells of the
true heroism and kind-heartedness which combined
seem to belong specially to the medical staff of our
army.  The doctor and his servant, I may add, had
neither tent nor accommodation of any kind.
</p>

<p>
The story of the doctor's heroism ends briefly thus:
</p>

<p>
The wounded were dying on his hands day after
day, and he and M'Grath struggled hard to bury
them; but when, on the 26th, Captain Lushington of
the <i>Albion</i> and his blue-jackets arrived, they had to
remove about forty dead before they could reach the
living.  These latter were nearly all carried on board
ship, when a force of the enemy appeared, and they
were obliged to abandon their task.  The Russian
wounded were sent under flag of truce to Odessa.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There was much disappointment shown among the
officers of Llewellyn's regiment when it was found
that they were not to follow up the victory on the
day after it, and march right to attack the northern
forts.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps no one was more disappointed than Sir
Colin Campbell, though he did not show it.
</p>

<p>
Neither Grant nor Llewellyn Morgan, however, took
any pains to conceal their chagrin.
</p>

<p>
"May we ask what it means, sir?" Llewellyn took
the liberty of saying.  "Does Lord Raglan&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my young friend, hush!" said Sir Colin.
"Lord Raglan is bold enough to have gone on even
last night, but Marshal St. Arnaud thinks the armies
are too tired."
</p>

<p>
"Too tired!" cried Grant.  "Confound the fellow,
let him speak for his own troops.  They may be
tired, tired looking on&mdash;it was all they did; but we
fought, and will fight again."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, true; and if I were commander-in-chief,
St. Arnaud should not rule me.  I'd leave him to rest.
But, my dear fellows, we must obey; obedience is a
duty&mdash;when expedient."
</p>

<p>
The last words were spoken <i>sotto voce</i>, and more to
himself than to the junior officers.
</p>

<p>
But Grant and Llewellyn smiled.  They smiled heartily.
</p>

<p>
All along the route to the river Belbek, the arms and
accoutrements, the dead and the struggling wounded,
showed how complete the rout of the Russians had
been, and how great their haste to escape.
</p>

<p>
At the mouth of the Belbek river the Scots Greys
and another regiment were disembarked, and soon
after the march was resumed.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Menschikoff, who was an able tactician,
sunk seven ships of war across the harbour mouth
of Sebastopol, thus preventing our vessels from getting
in, while those of his ships safely inside could
pour a deadly fire upon the northern forts should
they be attacked.
</p>

<p>
It is said by some that Lord Raglan consulted his
chief engineer, Sir John Burgoyne, as to the
feasibility of such an attack.  This is denied by others.
</p>

<p>
However, a grand flank march was now determined
upon, and a reconnaissance in some force was sent
onwards to M'Kenzie's Farm, the army following on.
The march was continued now to Traktir Bridge on
the Balaklava road.
</p>

<p>
On the banks of the river our troops bivouacked
for the night, and soon after, from the light in the
sky, it was evident the French had occupied the
M'Kenzie heights that we had just left.
</p>

<p>
Menschikoff, strangely enough, had passed our army
without knowing it, within five miles or less of
M'Kenzie's Farm.  In fact, many of his last waggons,
containing baggage, were captured.  Still he did not
know we were making that historical flank march.
He was on his way to the upper part of the river
Belbek, with the intention of keeping open the
communications with Southern Russia, and receiving
reinforcements.  Cathcart's division, I wish you to note,
had been left to cover the rear of our march, and to
send the sick and wounded on to the mouth of the
Katcha, where they would be embarked on the French
and British ships.
</p>

<p>
Now the object of this flank march was to seize
Balaklava town, and it was desirable that our ships
should co-operate there with us.
</p>

<p>
And it is just here that I wish to tell you about
Jack Mackenzie's adventure&mdash;that is, his first real
adventure on Crimean soil.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> was a handy little craft, and consequently
had all kinds of work to do.
</p>

<p>
Bold Dr. Reikie was as busy as busy could be, and
though he had to take many a cargo of sick to the
large ships or transports, luckily enough the cholera
had not yet broken out on board of this gunboat.
</p>

<p>
Both he and Jack were ashore at the mouth of the
Katcha when Admiral Lyons wished to open up
communication with Lord Raglan, now on the Tchernaya.
Who would volunteer to take a message?  Many
would; but our brave hero Jack was recommended by
Captain Gillespie, who was loud in the young fellow's
praises.
</p>

<p>
"You feel confident you will succeed?"
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it, sir," said Jack boldly.  "I'm
young, sir, and active.  I'm also an excellent
hockey-player, and not too tall."
</p>

<p>
The admiral laughed.
</p>

<p>
"As to hockey," he said, "I don't know if that be
any recommendation.  Well, I will trust you, and you
must bring an answer as soon as possible without
killing yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, doctor," said Jack, when he was ready
for the march.  "I'm so glad.  I'll see Cousin Llewellyn
too, if he is not among the slain."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, old man.  <i>Bon voyage</i>.  You're a lucky
dog.  Don't come back with your head under your
arm, and your promotion is certain."
</p>

<p>
Jack determined to make a record.  He took no
arms with him save a revolver and his dirk.  To
support his strength, the provision he made was
simple in the extreme&mdash;namely, a couple of ship
biscuits and a bottle of water.  The biscuits were so
full of weevils that he wouldn't want for fresh meat
anyhow.
</p>

<p>
He started in the afternoon, and in less than two
hours he had reached the Belbek.  He had crossed
hill and dell and grassy slope very much as the crow
flies; but having reached the river, he went onwards
up the banks.  He must strike the trail of the allied
armies, for if he lost the road it would be indeed a
poor record he should make.
</p>

<p>
After striking the trail of the army, he crossed the
river by a ford.  The river looked rather deep, but
if the worst came to the worst he could swim.  The
water did look deep though, so he did what many a
Scotsman has done before him: he partially undressed
and waded through bravely.  After getting inside his
clothes again, he sat down to rest, and to munch a
biscuit.  The sun was getting very low, however, so he
soon got up and hurried on again.  He had six miles
to go before he could reach M'Kenzie's Farm, and
nearly the same distance before he came to the British
camp on the Tchernaya.  But what was that to a
young fellow like him, and a hockey-player to boot?
The path he followed now was very rough.  He
hugged the waggon tracks.
</p>

<p>
The country was a wooded or at least a bush-covered
one, but all silent and deserted.  When night
fell it found him still struggling on, and he knew by
the stars that the road was now taking him more
inland.  When he came near a hill at last, he left the
trench, and climbed it to have a look around.  What
a scene!  Far away beneath him glinted the lights
of Sebastopol harbour, doubled and tripled as they
sparkled on the water; and still farther off was the
darkness of the star-lit sea itself.  But yonder in the
south-east a moon was struggling with a bank of
clouds, low down on what appeared to be a woody
horizon.
</p>

<p>
Jack was preparing to descend and resume his
journey, when not far in his rear he heard voices.
He had barely time to get into hiding under a
friendly bush, when four men, evidently Russian
soldiers, passed almost close by him.  Jack afterwards
learned that, like himself, these men had come from
the Belbek, but from the upper regions thereof.  In
fact they were emissaries from Menschikoff, on their
way to Sebastopol to obtain news as to the
whereabouts of the invaders.
</p>

<p>
Jack was glad enough when they had passed.  But,
lo, they had not gone twenty yards away when they
threw themselves on the ground to rest.  Then they
proceeded leisurely to light a fire.
</p>

<p>
As this burned up, Jack crept further back under
the shadow of the bush&mdash;a species of dwarf yew&mdash;lest
his face or figure might be seen.  He was so
close to them that he could hear every word they
said.  As, however, they spoke in the Russian
language, this was not of much advantage to Jack.
</p>

<p>
Probably I myself am no born linguist, though I
can manage to bless myself in two or three tongues;
but the Russian, whenever I attempted it, always
seemed to loosen all my teeth.
</p>

<p>
The greybacks had laid down their arms, and
proceeded to make themselves very comfortable indeed.
They had their toes towards the fire and pipes
between their teeth&mdash;the stalks of the pipes at all
events.  Now and then they laid aside their pipes to
stuff their maws with coarse bread.  Then they made
many applications to black bottles, and seemed to get
jollier every minute.
</p>

<p>
When these fellows laughed, they opened great black
cavernous mouths, and threw their legs straight out in
front of them, as if afraid of the cramp.  No wonder
that the very night-birds screamed and flew flapping
away from the neighbouring trees at the sounds.
</p>

<p>
More and more bottle! more merriment!
</p>

<p>
Jack greatly feared they were going to make a
night of it, but did not dare to stir.
</p>

<p>
Further applications of the bottle; then one fellow
volunteered a song.
</p>

<p>
Neither words nor music appealed to Jack, who
was hoping the man would choke.  The melody&mdash;save
the mark!&mdash;was like the rattling of a lot of
pebbles in a frying-pan.  The words were a kind of
Irish stew or pan-hagglety of German, Chinese,
Turkish, and Sanscrit, with a little Gaelic and broad
Scotch thrown in to give it smoothness.
</p>

<p>
But now from a wallet the soldier who seemed in
command drew forth some papers.  He looked at and
counted them, then put them carefully away again.
They appeared to Jack to be plans, and he at once
formed the daring resolve of possessing himself of
them by hook or by crook.
</p>

<p>
Jack hoped it would be by hook.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant placed the wallet on the moss behind
him, and very handy for Jack.
</p>

<p>
Then the sergeant had another drink.  The man
next him said something while he drank; upon
which, without for a moment taking the bottle from
his lips, the officer let out from the shoulder with his
left, and the soldier rolled back on the moss.  The
others guffawed, and the boisterous merriment continued.
</p>

<p>
Jack was getting uneasy, for time was important,
and it was now well on in the night.
</p>

<p>
As he was moving round a little to ease his position,
his hand rested on a stone of considerable size.
This might come in handy, he thought, so he rolled it
towards him.
</p>

<p>
The men, after another drink or two, turned quiet.
They seemed to doze.  But they had drawn their
rifles quite close up to their knees in readiness.
</p>

<p>
Presently they appeared to be talking Russian
through their noses.  Jack allowed them to snore for
fully ten minutes.  Then he slowly arose.
</p>

<p>
The fire had burned rather low.  The stars away
in the west burned very brightly, but the moon cast
no shadow.  Clutching the big stone, and making
sure his dirk and revolver were handy, Jack stalked
out into the open, listening like a thief at every
step.
</p>

<p>
He could have brained the sergeant with the stone
he carried, but he had no wish to do that.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer!
</p>

<p>
He was just about to pick up the wallet, when one
man awoke with a growl like that of a wolf.
</p>

<p>
There was no more time for ceremony.
</p>

<p>
Jack imitated the Highland slogan, and with all
his might he dashed the stone into the dying embers.
Dust and fire flew in all directions.
</p>

<p>
Jack flew also.
</p>

<p>
It was time.
</p>

<p>
But he had that wallet safe enough.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the men's energies seemed paralyzed.
Speedily they recovered, however, and took up the
running, firing after Jack at random.
</p>

<p>
The country had become more open, and when our
hero looked about presently, there was but one man
in pursuit.  The others had been shaken off.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for Jack, who, hockey-player though he
was, felt almost pumped out, the moon gave a little
more light just then.  He stopped.  On came the
man with a hoop of rejoicing; but Jack's revolver
rang out twice, sharp and clear on the night air, and
the pursuer rejoiced no more.  He threw up his arms,
and fell fiat on his face.
</p>

<p>
Jack grasped revolver and wallet still more firmly
and ran on.
</p>

CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE FIRST GREAT BOMBARDMENT&mdash;SHIPS <i>VERSUS</i><br />
FORTS&mdash;POOR BOY HARRIS&mdash;"TELL 'EM I DIED LIKE A<br />
THOUSAND O' BRICKS."<br />
</h3>

<p>
The bold young hockey-player ran on and on;
first as hard as he could fly, then only in a
swinging sort of trot that he felt he could keep up
long enough.  Once or twice he lost himself, but
soon got on the track again.  He was guided now as
much by a glare in the sky&mdash;which he knew must
be the French camp&mdash;as by the rough tracks through
the bush.
</p>

<p>
And long before he came near the camp he was
hailed by the outpost sentry.  Jack answered in very
questionable French but in a very short time he
was telling the story of his adventures to Marshal
Canrobert himself.
</p>

<p>
Yes, this general was now in command of the
French forces, and poor St. Arnaud was dying.  He
had turned faint some days before, and fallen off his
horse.  The moment they saw him the doctors had
given him up for lost.  He was plague-stricken.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning Jack was in the British camp,
and had delivered his message and handed over the
wallet.  This contained important letters from
Menschikoff himself, but whether they were of any utility
or not I cannot say, only Lord Raglan complimented
Jack very highly indeed, and even found time in a
letter he sent back to Admiral Lyons to recommend
our young hero for promotion.
</p>

<p>
Lord Raglan offered Jack an escort back, but this
was politely but pluckily declined.
</p>

<p>
"One man, my lord"&mdash;the reader will note that
Jack talked of himself as a man&mdash;"one man can
move along more quickly and make less noise than
half a dozen."
</p>

<p>
His lordship laughed in his good-natured, fatherly
way, and gave in.
</p>

<p>
After this, Jack saw and shook hands with Sir
Colin Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Man, you're a birkie,"* said Sir Colin.  "I like
you.  Don't be rash, though.  Study war, if study
it you must, as an exact science.  Not that 'go' and
'movement' don't count, for they do.  Before the
battle you must be a lynx; during the fight you may
be a bull.  Good-morning.  Good-luck to you, lad.
We may meet again."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Birkie," a brave young fellow.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well, I declare!" cried stalwart young Llewellyn,
who had his left hand in a sling.  "Why, you
turn up at the oddest times and in the drollest ways.
By this and by that, Jack, I am glad to see you.
But how haggard and hungry you look!  Come and
have breakfast.  Grant will be glad to see you.  My
arm?  Oh, nothing, only a chip of a Russian shell
tore my coat."
</p>

<p>
"And tore the flesh?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a little.  Come on.  And what made you
take this adventure in hand?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Llew I took it in hand just to please mother
and sister, and the old lady, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jack blushed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you old rascal, I do believe you'll end by marrying
Tottie.*  But I am told she will soon not be Tottie
but Tott-o.  She is growing tall and very pretty."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

<p>
"She always was.  Well, I'm so pleased we've met again."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; where next, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, at Balaklava.  We're going to help you to
batter the place down."
</p>

<p>
"Batter it down we must not.  That must be our
seaport, Jack Mackenzie."
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p>
Jack reached the admiral's ship in safety, but not
without a further adventure.  This was only part of
the last, however.  For sitting against a tree, and
looking very faint and weak, was the very Russian
he had shot.
</p>

<p>
Jack shared his water with him, and bound up his
wound, which was through the right biceps.  Then he
left beside him a portion of the food he had brought
for himself, and hoping his friends would speedily find
him, went trotting off once more.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p>
The question whether or not Sebastopol could have
been carried by assault during the last days of
September is one we need not pause to consider now,
but Cathcart was in favour of it, and even the clever
Russian, Colonel Todleben, one of the historians of
the war, admits that the assault might have been
successful.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Upland to the south of Sebastopol
that most of the fighting and suffering would now
take place, or around it.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-265"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-265.jpg" alt="Map of Balaklava town and harbour" />
</p>

<p>
The town and harbour of Balaklava itself had soon
fallen into our possession, and the allies were
encamped on the plateau above it (<a href="#img-265"><i>vide</i> plan</a>), formerly
called the Chersonese, and now, as I have said, "the
Upland."
</p>

<p>
An attack on the north side of Sebastopol, you will
perceive, was never seriously contemplated, though
Todleben had made every preparation to repel it.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning of the second of October, the
women, children, and non-combatants left Sebastopol,
with as much of their goods and chattels as they
could conveniently carry.  A dreary journey away
north lay before them, but it was imperative.  War
knows no sentiment where her interests are concerned.
Bellona is indeed a stern mistress.  But thus
relieved, the great and wise engineer, Todleben, found
himself quite unshackled in the defence.  The mere
drones had left the great hive, and so he bent all his
energies to strengthening the works and forts.
</p>

<p>
Balaklava itself was but a very insignificant place
indeed, but it would gain importance henceforward,
and be the base of our supplies.
</p>

<p>
The "town" of Balaklava and its old ports had very
quickly been silenced by a few shots from one of our
ships; and when our army appeared on the heights,
we found that communication with the fleets was
already open.
</p>

<p>
But having taken it, we were graciously permitted
by the French to retain it, and with it the right side
of the allied line.  I believe that in those days the
French could see as far through a milestone as most
people.  Anyhow, with Balaklava and the right we
chose much sorrow, and an amount of suffering to our
troops that not even the pen of Kinglake has
overdrawn.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
A glance or two at the plan (<a href="#img-296">p. 294</a>) will give the
reader as good an idea of Sebastopol's outer and inner
harbour as pages of text can.
</p>

<p>
The following brief sentences, however, from the
pen of General Sir Edward Hamley, K.C.B.,* may
be read with interest:&mdash;"The roadstead of Sebastopol
is a creek about four miles long from the point where
it breaks, nearly at right angles, the coast-line to its
extremity where the Tchernaya flows into it.  It
maintains a great depth throughout, even close to the
shore.  On the points that mark the entrance stood
two forts&mdash;that on the north named Constantine; on
the south, Alexander.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This gentleman's succinct and clever book, "The War in the
Crimea."  Lecky and Co., publishers.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"After entering the roadstead ...... and about a
mile from the entrance, the inner or man-o'-war
harbour ran for a mile and a half into the southern
shore.  On the two points that mark this inlet
stood two other forts, Nicholas and Paul.  On the
west shore of this inner creek stood the city of
Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
"The plateau or plain where the allied armies
stood&mdash;the Upland&mdash;was marked off from the Tchernaya
by a wall of cliff, which, following up that stream
southward for about a mile from its mouth, turns
round south-west and defines the valley of Balaklava,
passing about a mile north of that place, and joining
the sea-cliffs."
</p>

<p>
The Malakoff, the Redan, and Mamelon are all seen
on the plan.
</p>

<p>
The French had the left of the Upland, and made
the inlets near Cape Kherson, called Kazatch and
Kamiesch Bays, their base; and the latter was
speedily filled with their shipping, which landed their
tents and stores on a temporary raft.  There was
around this bay quite a town of tents.  Moreover,
the French made a well-paved road from it all along
the rear of their division, facing Sebastopol.  It will
be seen, therefore, that our Gallic allies knew how
to make themselves snug.
</p>

<p>
The Upland is divided from south to north by the
great ravine, separating the French and English at
first, but afterwards taken possession of by the
French siege-corps.
</p>

<p>
The plan shows where the cliffs sweep round to
the north of Balaklava, and these the French fortified.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the great ravine, you would have found
first the Third and Fourth English Divisions, then
the Light Division, with, on its right, the Careenage
Creek; and on the other side of this ravine the Second
Division, looking towards the Inkermann heights, and
in its rear the First Division, about a hundred yards
back, and also resting its right on the rocky edge of
the Upland.
</p>

<p>
One vulnerable point in the British line was the
valley of Balaklava.  A reference to the plan will
show the Woronzoff Road, which goes to the left up
the cliff and thence to Sebastopol.  Another branch
of this road goes on to M'Kenzie heights, and away
north and west towards Southern Russia.  This road
ought to have been strongly fortified from Balaklava
to the Upland.  As it was, the Russians could get to
Balaklava out of reach of the guns on the edge of the
Upland, and we must descend to the valley to repel
them.
</p>

<p>
On the north-east of Balaklava were the heights
of Kamara, and a row of heights crossed the valley
from here to the Upland.  On these some works were
made carrying twelve-pounder guns and manned
by Turks.  Below these heights, and between them
and Balaklava harbour, the 93rd Highlanders were
posted.  Marines&mdash;over a thousand, with guns brought
from the ships&mdash;were placed to the right of the
harbour on the heights, while cavalry were also stationed
below the cliffs of the Upland, and not far from the
Highlanders.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The siege of Sebastopol was now begun in earnest,
under the supervision of Burgoyne.  The French,
taking advantage of a stormy night, threw up their
first trench on Mount Rodolph.  This was 1,100
yards in length.  Then on the next two nights we
opened our first on Green Hill and Mount Woronzoff.
Although the Russians by their cannonade succeeded
in doing considerable mischief to our trenches by day,
at night they were repaired and pushed on.  On the
16th these were ready and mounted for siege.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was agreed that a simultaneous attack should be
made by land and sea, although the strength of the
great stone forts did not appear very promising for
our wooden ships.  The proposal emanated from Lord
Raglan, and Admiral Dundas gave a kind of unwilling
consent to it.
</p>

<p>
The fifteenth of October was a big and a busy day
with the fleets, for a great naval conference assembled,
and boats were flying from ship to ship, busily
enough, with officers in cocked hats, and in their
"war-paint," as Dr. Reikie called it.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy and his friend Jack Mackenzie watched the
scene with great interest from the deck of the saucy
<i>Gurnet</i>.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of it, sir?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Think of it! think of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, our chance of success against the forts?"
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said Sturdy.  "What would you think
of a man who tried to break a cocoa-nut by shying
rotten pears at it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I'd think him a fool."
</p>

<p>
"Well, our admiral is&mdash;ahem!"
</p>

<p>
I am not going to say whether it was Dundas or
Lyons that Sturdy referred to, though I think I know.
Anyhow this honest sailor had a habit of saying just
exactly what he thought.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," said Jack, somewhat dolefully, "I
suppose there won't be much chance of my winning
my epaulettes during the bombardment."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" again grunted Sturdy.  "I don't know
about epaulettes; but if a Russian shell or a bigger
shot than usual catches us between wind and water,
it'll be a halo you'll soon be wearing, instead of
epaulettes, lad."
</p>

<p>
The first great cannonade, then, between our land
forces and Sebastopol began on the seventeenth of
October, as early as half-past six.  The bombardment,
the great fight betwixt trench and fort, was fearful,
and lasted for four hours&mdash;a perfect <i>feu d'enfer</i>.
</p>

<p>
We&mdash;the British&mdash;silenced Malakoff Tower and
damaged other Russian works.  But the French were
far less successful; for about ten o'clock the magazine
of Mount Rodolph was exploded by a Russian shell,
killing and wounding nearly a hundred men, and by
half-past ten the batteries of the French were
completely silenced.
</p>

<p>
Our guns, however, kept on: we not only silenced
the batteries round the Malakoff, but by three o'clock
we had partly destroyed the parapets of the famous
Redan, blowing up a magazine, with a loss to the
Russians, as we afterwards discovered, of over a
hundred men.  We had avenged the poor French
therefore.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-281"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-281.jpg" alt="She laid about her right and left." />
<br />
She laid about her right and left.
</p>

<p>
The calamity, however, which they had fallen under
prevented the intended assault on the Flagstaff
Bastion, which they were to have made side by side with
us.  Compared with the French, our losses in this
bombardment were but slight&mdash;under fifty in all&mdash;while
in killed and wounded the Russians lost over
a thousand.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But alas for Jack Mackenzie's hopes of glory either
in the shape of epaulettes or a halo&mdash;by the way,
though, I do not think that he was particularly anxious
about the halo; he said he didn't want to be caught
out in his first innings&mdash;for neither our own bold
ships nor those of the French effected anything worth
speaking of, although in all they had brought 1,100
guns into action.  The Russians lost but 140 men,
the French over 200, and our fleet 320.
</p>

<p>
"I told you," said Sturdy to Jack, when the <i>Gurnet</i>,
with the rest of the ships, had been withdrawn&mdash;"I
told you we would be beaten.  A beastly waste of
gunpowder, I call it, and honest fellows' lives."
</p>

<p>
How very busy the Russians had been that night
may be inferred from the fact that the dawn of the
eighteenth day of October saw their breaches repaired,
more guns mounted, and all the effects of the terrible
bombardment entirely effaced.
</p>

<p>
On the twenty-third of October, the <i>Gurnet</i> being
round at Balaklava, Dr. Reikie received from the
trenches, among other wounded, our old friend the
boy Harris.  He had belonged to Peel's naval brigade,
and very gallantly he had fought.  Before the fighting
had commenced, some weeks indeed, he had been one
of the very merriest among our blue-jackets who
helped to tow the guns up to the heights.
</p>

<p>
He had been cut down by a piece of shell which
completely carried away his right arm.  He had
begged very hard to be sent on board the <i>Gurnet</i>,
and although the surgeon who attended him believed
from the first the case was hopeless, he had yielded to
his request.  He was placed under the awning in a
hammock amidships.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he said, "I can die a kind o' easy now.
Bother my wig, though, I should have liked to have
seen the last of it.  Ain't there any hope, doctor,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'll sit up with you," he said, "and&mdash;-see."
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes, I understand."
</p>

<p>
He lay still for a few minutes.  Then he asked for
his ditty-box&mdash;a small box possessed by every young
sailor in which to keep his trinkets and valuables.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor, sir," he said, "you'll send this little box
to my mother and father, won't you?  Here is the
old couple.  I'll keep this as long as I last.  Tell
them that I died like a thousand o' bricks."
</p>

<p>
That was his last joke.  He fell quietly to sleep
with the little case containing his parents' portrait on
his breast.
</p>

<p>
He never woke again.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE VICTORIOUS CHARGE OF THE HEAVY BRIGADE&mdash;THE<br />
SCOTCH WIFE AND THE TURKS&mdash;THE LIGHT BRIGADE,<br />
AND THEIR AWFUL CHARGE.<br />
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile, where was Menschikoff?
</p>

<p>
That question may well begin a fresh
chapter.  He had gone north, as I have said, to keep
the communications open, and he did so most effectually.
Not only did he get 12,000 troops around him
that had not yet been in action, but soon received
reinforcements from Russia, in addition to these, till
his army swelled to 22,000, besides 3,500 horsemen
and 78 guns.
</p>

<p>
He thought it was time to return now and see
what we were about.
</p>

<p>
He was careful not to show his great resources.
This might have frightened us into action sooner than
was desirable.
</p>

<p>
Spies were very busy; nor was there much difficulty
in such espionage, and it was soon found out
that, bar the somewhat weak works manned by
Turks on the range of heights I have already
mentioned as stretching from Kamara Hills to the Upland
across the valley of Balaklava, there was nothing
much to fear between them and our camp.  The 93rd
were certainly something, but they could easily crush
them by sheer force of numbers; and as for the
Turks and marines round the harbour of Balaklava,
well, they were too far away to take into account.
</p>

<p>
The height nearest to Kamara was called Canrobert's
Hill.  That was speedily taken, and so was
the next one to it.  The Turks with their twelve-pounders
had done all they could, and artillery had
also been hurried up to help them, supported by the
Scots Greys.
</p>

<p>
These had soon, however, to retreat for want of
ammunition.
</p>

<p>
The Turks were beaten back, and fled, after a
stubborn resistance, towards Balaklava.
</p>

<p>
At first Lord Raglan&mdash;it was early on the morning
of the twenty-fifth of October&mdash;was not fully
apprised of the real nature of the onslaught.  I do
not think the allies expected that the Russians would
assume the offensive.  But now the Fourth and First
British Divisions were speedily turned out, and with
them two brigades of the French.
</p>

<p>
And then a mistake was made on our part; for
instead of the First Division being taken down to
the plain by the Woronzoff Road, where they could
have hurled the Russians back, they were marched
along the Upland edge to the more southerly road
leading down to Kadikoi.
</p>

<p>
In the valley next the Tchernaya was the Light
Cavalry Brigade, commanded by Lord Cardigan,
and on the other side of the ridge and captured
heights was the Heavy Brigade.  This, which had
lately joined our forces, was commanded by General
Scarlett.  It was made up of the 4th and 5th
Dragoon Guards, with the Scots Greys, Royals, and
Inniskillings.
</p>

<p>
The Light Brigade was, at the time of the terrible
attack made by the Russians on the Heavy, remaining
on the defensive on the other side of the captured
ridge; and the whole was commanded by Lord
Lucan.
</p>

<p>
Lord Raglan on the heights, among his marching
divisions, saw the advance of the Russian army <i>en
masse</i> on the Heavy Brigade.  As they came on
they threw out a line on each flank with artillery
to play on our troops on the Upland.  Their shot,
however, fell short.
</p>

<p>
The Heavy Brigade were at first, in a measure,
taken by surprise, and, moreover, embarrassed somewhat
by their own lines, and so were a little time in
getting clear.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, some Turkish guns on the edge of the
Upland began to play on the Russian cavalry, which
soon galloped off.
</p>

<p>
But clear now, the Heavy Brigade charged in earnest.
</p>

<p>
And such a charge!
</p>

<p>
It was a scene that Lord Raglan could not have
forgotten till his dying day.  Here was in reality
the very romance of war itself.  Nothing was
wanting in effect or colour&mdash;our prancing horses, the
splendid uniforms of the troopers, the lightning
glitter of sabres, and the thunder of the charging
feet.  On and on they dash; and now foe meets foe,
and every horseman becomes the single centre of
crowds of the enemy.  But, apart from this front
and terrible pell-mell charge, behold the 4th
Dragoons&mdash;held back for a time&mdash;gallop thundering up now
and attack the enemy's flank.
</p>

<p>
What Russian force can stand it?  What can the
enemy do but turn and fly?  And in less time than
it takes me to tell it, they have swept back over the
slope whence they had come, leaving the ground
flecked with their bleeding dead and wounded.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
In the next tableau of this eventful battle Llewellyn's
regiment took part; for during the charge of
the Heavy Brigade, some squadrons of the Russian
cavalry made straight for the entrance to the harbour.
</p>

<p>
They reckoned without their host for once in a way.
That host was Sir Colin himself, with the 93rd Highlanders,
who were lying down concealed behind a slope.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! it is one thing," said Grant, "for these grey-backs
to send a parcel of slatternly old Turks down
from their heights harbour-way here; let them come
down this way themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Look, then," cried Llewellyn; "here they come!"
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer thundered the Russian horse.  Then
at the word of command up sprang the wild Highlanders
and showed their tartans and plumes on the hillock.
</p>

<p>
Next moment the whole regiment would have
charged, and probably been cut up.  But the shout
from their leader quelled them at once.
</p>

<p>
"Ninety-third!  Ninety-third!" cried Sir Colin;
"hang all such eagerness!  Stand fast!  Fire!"
</p>

<p>
There was a rattling volley.  The Russian squadron
was checked, but attempted now to outflank Sir Colin.
</p>

<p>
But that hero quickly placed his grenadiers round,
and again the squadron paused, and finally fled.
</p>

<p>
It takes greater bravery and pluck to wait inactive
on hillside or in wood for the advance of a foe than
it does to repel a charge.  If ever soldiers are really
frightened, it is while waiting thus.  But in the 93rd
Regiment there was none of this excessive nervousness.
In their broad Doric they laughed and chaffed,
as they used to at night when safe in camp.  And
when the Turks came flying harbourwards in despair,
and a few of them rushed into the camp of the
Highlanders, a scene took place that caused every
officer and man in this gallant regiment to laugh
aloud.  For, thinking that these men were about to
pillage the camp, out from one of the tents,
porridge-stick in hand, rushed a tall and powerful
Highlander's wife.
</p>

<p>
She laid about her right and left.  Like Roderick
Dhu, she
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Showered her blows like wintry rain."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Whack, whack, whack rang the blows; and the
woman's tongue was by no means idle the while.
Whack, whack.  "De'il rot ye, for a lot o' rievin'
rascals.  You'll no come here to steal while oor
gudemen's awa."
</p>

<p>
"Kokona! kokona!"* cried the Turks.  "Mercy, mercy!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
* Lady, lady.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Bravo, Betty!" shouted a soldier.  "Let them
tak that, as they can tak no snuff."
</p>

<p>
The 93rd were indeed glorious soldiers, but just a
trifle wild and impetuous.
</p>

<p>
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But a charge more terrible than that of the good
Scot's wife was soon to be made.  This was the
world-famous charge of the 600&mdash;the charge of the
Light Brigade.
</p>

<p>
This brigade, it will be remembered, consisted of
the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, the 17th Lancers,
and 8th and 11th Hussars, and was commanded by
Lord Cardigan.  I have already told you where it
was stationed.
</p>

<p>
The terrible charge, through two flanking fires, to
capture guns at the other end of the valley, was the
result of a mistake.
</p>

<p>
For a full and detailed account of it&mdash;and it reads
like a romance of the olden time&mdash;I must refer the
reader to the great Crimean historian Kinglake.
</p>

<p>
The mistake seems to have been made by Lord
Raglan, who thought the enemy were in full retreat,
and that they were about to carry away the guns
from the heights they had first captured.
</p>

<p>
Twice he sent orders in writing to Lord Lucan to
advance the cavalry rapidly to the front, and prevent
the enemy from carrying away these guns.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nolan took this order to Lord Lucan.
Lord Lucan, as the enemy was not retreating,
naturally asked Nolan, "What guns?"
</p>

<p>
Nolan answered, almost disrespectfully and tauntingly,
"There, my lord, is the enemy," pointing towards
the valley; "there are your guns."
</p>

<p>
Lord Lucan rode off to Cardigan.
</p>

<p>
"You are to charge right down the valley with
your brigade.  The Heavies will follow in support."
</p>

<p>
He looked at Lucan.  His very look seemed to
imply that there must be some mistake.
</p>

<p>
"This means death&mdash;annihilation," he thought; "but
it is Lord Raglan's orders.  A soldier's first duty is
obedience."
</p>

<p>
"The brigade will advance!" shouted Cardigan,
and in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
And right down that valley of death they charged
upon the twelve guns in front.  A splinter from the
very first shell killed Captain Nolan, who was
waving his sword and riding obliquely across the front
of this mad attack.  Why he was there or what he
meant may never be guessed.  Back through the
ranks of the 13th flew his startled horse, bearing the
body of his master&mdash;lifeless.
</p>

<p>
In a very short time Cardigan and his brave brigade
were in the thick of it&mdash;death on every side,
death in front, shattering shells, roaring shot overhead,
and saddles emptied every second; horses and riders
falling together, horses galloping riderless into the
still more awful fire that poured upon them when
they neared the twelve guns.  The valley was strewed
with the dead and the wounded&mdash;the latter, whether
horses or men, sometimes rising, but to fall dead next
moment.
</p>

<p>
The Russians themselves must have thought them mad.
</p>

<p>
Yet that brave brigade knew no fear, no faltering;
straight into the ranks of the foe rode they, and
smoke and fire for a time swallowed them up.  The
Russian gunners were cut down where they stood, or
driven from their guns, and our men even charged
the enemy's cavalry.
</p>

<p>
They had done their duty!
</p>

<p>
They had obeyed orders as they had been understood.
But alas, and yet alas! when the brigade
returned the whole numbered but 195!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Russians were certainly beaten at Balaklava,
and no clasp glitters with greater honour on the
Crimean medal that adorns the breasts of our sturdy
veterans; but we lost ground by it.
</p>

<p>
It might have been well for us had we chosen as
our base the bay of Kamiesch, in conjunction with
the French.
</p>

<p>
But a greater battle than all was soon to follow
Balaklava.

CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE TRUTH FROM A RUSSIAN&mdash;PARABLE OF THE<br />
STOAT AND THE WILD CAT&mdash;DAY-DAWN OF THE<br />
MEMORABLE FIFTH.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, remember<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth of November&mdash;<br />
  Gunpowder, treason, and shot."<br />
</p>

<p>
Cut out the word "treason" from the last line,
and the old-fashioned Guy Fawkes doggerel
does very well as a heading for this chapter.
</p>

<p>
Guy Fawkes had intended to blow up the Houses
of Parliament, I believe&mdash;that is if my memory serves
me aright.  Well, reader, boys like you and me don't
take much note of politics, do we?  For my own
part, I think golf is far better, or that grandest
athletic game in the world, curling.  But
politics&mdash;faugh! it is cold work, and insincere besides.  Didn't
Carlyle say something about a House (give it a
capital letter, printer, for goodness' sake)&mdash;about a
House wherein six hundred jackasses bray?  So that,
as jackasses are plentiful enough&mdash;the human sort,
I mean&mdash;everywhere, the loss of six hundred in a
House could very soon be got over.  But how about
the six hundred hero-hearts that took part in the
memorable charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava,
so few of whom came back to tell the tale?
</p>

<p>
Give me the hero, I say, and you may do what
you please with your politicians and your members
of Parliament, hundreds of whom have no more
heart and brains than the snow-man which my
bairnies are at this moment setting up on the lawn
out yonder, and are of just as little use.
</p>

<p>
This is a digression, is it?  Call me to order, then;
but I shall digress if I choose, and after a wild fight
like Balaklava, and with another still more awful
battle hanging over my head, it is no wonder that
I should want a very brief breathing-spell.  Well,
where can men breathe better, I should like to know,
than on the ocean wave?  So let us get afloat again,
if only for a day.
</p>

<p>
Look at her there, on this bright morning in late
October, bobbing and courtesying to every dark-blue
wave that goes singing past her dark sides&mdash;our own
bonnie <i>Gurnet</i> once again.  There is a spanking
breeze blowing; the wake astern of her is hardly
any length at all, for the rippling, racing seas soon
obliterate every bubble.  There is life, there is
health in this jolly breeze; it braces one up, pulis
one together, till there isn't a loose tendon or nerve
anywhere about one's whole system.
</p>

<p>
Six bells in the morning watch, but Midshipman
Mackenzie is on deck already, and walking the
quarter-deck with Sturdy.  Rapidly fore and aft
they tread, sometimes beating their gloved hands to
instil a little extra glow into them, sometimes
stowing them away in the outside pockets of their
uniform reefing jackets.  The ship has been cruising off
Odessa, but is now making all sail south for the port
of Balaklava.
</p>

<p>
"What is that out yonder on our weather-bow?"
says Jack.
</p>

<p>
"A sail, and a Russian, too," replies Sturdy, after
a squint through his glass.  "Wonder what the
dickens she wants in our Black Sea.  Come, we'll
luff, and see what her game is.  Can we carry a bit
more canvas?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, lots, if you ask me."
</p>

<p>
"Then I think I'll crack on."
</p>

<p>
At eight o'clock the sail sighted became a chase.
She had put about, and was going full before the
wind.  As fleet as an ocean greyhound was she, so
the good <i>Gurnet</i> had to get up steam, for the wind
began to fail.
</p>

<p>
An hour after breakfast the <i>Gurnet</i> was near
enough to fire a shot over her, then another, but
with no effect.
</p>

<p>
"Give her one now," cried Captain Gillespie&mdash;"straight."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," replied the gunner.&mdash;"Now, lass,"
he said, patting the breach of the great
pivot-gun&mdash;"now, lass, it's you and me."
</p>

<p>
The gunner wasn't particular about his grammar.
</p>

<p>
Brr-rr-rang!  Hurr-rsh!  The great shot tore
clean through the Russian's mizzentop, and brought
rigging, mast, and sail down, and these hung about
her like a broken wing on a badly-shot wild duck.
She hove to now smartly enough.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy and Dr. Reikie boarded her with an armed
boat.  It was humane to let "Auld Reikie" go in
the boat, for there might be blood about or broken
bones.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, sweetheart!" said the gunner to his pet
as the boat went speeding away.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy was in a temper.  The skipper of the
barque came up bowing and scraping, as
ungainly-looking a heap of old clothes, Sturdy thought, as
ever loafed along a ship's deck.  Our brave first
lieutenant hadn't enough Russian to bless himself
with, so he stuck to plain English&mdash;very plain
English, for he exploded thus,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why the Harry didn't you haul your rotten old
foreyard aback before?  Think we want to expend
good shot and shell over a lubber like you?"
</p>

<p>
The Russian skipper had a mouth like a haddock,
and now he seemed to smile all the way down to his
short and "gurkie" neck.  He made a rush aft a
little, and pulled out a black bottle and a cracked
tumbler.  He half filled it, laughed, and nodded
towards the <i>Gurnet</i>, and drank it off.  Then he half
filled it again, and held it towards Sturdy.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!" he said joyously, "she is a very goot
schnapp."
</p>

<p>
Even Sturdy smiled now; but he bluntly refused
the "very goot schnapp," and went straight to business.
</p>

<p>
"What is your beastly ship's name?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes.  Goot!"  Here the skipper proceeded
to pour the liquor back cautiously into the bottle;
but spilling a drop or two to begin with, he evidently
thought it would be a saving to swallow it.  "Huh!"
he cried, with water in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Your ship's name, sir!" roared Sturdy, stamping
his foot, and laying a hand upon his sword.  "Name
and cargo?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  Goot.  Ha! ha!  My sheep's name is
<i>Skrrovotchstriarrky</i>.  Loaded I am with cloves."
</p>

<p>
"Cloves!&mdash;What do you think the fellow means,
doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Clothes, I believe," said Reikie.
</p>

<p>
"Clothes?  Certainly, it must be that."
</p>

<p>
Sturdy felt pleased now.  Part of the cargo was
had on deck.  The doctor was right.  Truly a glorious
cargo&mdash;stockings, gloves, blankets, jackets, boots!
All had been made, apparently, to fit Greenland bears
Never mind, they were warm.
</p>

<p>
So a prize crew was put on board under command
of Sub-Lieutenant Fitzgerald, <i>alias</i> Lord Tomfoozle.
Then all sail was set, and away south went the <i>Gurnet</i>
with her prize.
</p>

<p>
But a stranger had come on board from the
barque&mdash;namely, a Russian gentleman and his
daughter, a rather pretty young lady, to whom,
with her maid, Captain Gillespie at once gave up
his cabin.
</p>

<p>
This Russian gentleman himself was singularly
communicative and remarkably free and candid.  He
spoke about the war, and in very good English; and
what is more, he spoke the truth.
</p>

<p>
He told the officers about Balaklava first.  They
had not heard of it before.
</p>

<p>
"It was a well-fought field," he said, "but hardly
a battle.  No; Alma was a battle.  I was there; I
was on Telegraph Hill.  Ah! how well your fellows
fought.  But your French&mdash;bah! they are only fit
to sell tape and ribbons.  Soldiers! no, no, not now,
and never will be again.  But you and your allies
made the grand mistake in not seizing Sebastopol
when you could have done so."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't too late yet, <i>mon ami</i>," laughed the
captain.  "We're going to take Sebastopol, and we
shan't leave one stone standing on top of another."
</p>

<p>
"My friend, do not think it cruel of me to speak
the truth.  The fruits of your Alma which your
Highlanders won, your Raglan permitted to escape.
Your bombardment was a waste of good gunpowder.
The part your ships took in it made us laugh."
</p>

<p>
"He laughs best," said Sturdy, "who laughs last."
</p>

<p>
"True; and it will be the Russians.  Listen.  You
are going to Balaklava.  Before you reach that port
a battle will be fought that shall decide the
war&mdash;fought, and won by us.  Ah, you may smile, but it
is true.  Already is the proud Eagle of Russia
sweeping down from the north.  There are armies
on the way that will crush you if you were twice as
strong and great.  You fight as fights the stoat when
the wild cat has seized her&mdash;a long, red, and vicious
line; but strength triumphs at last&mdash;the stoat dies.
Where will you be when our armies reach the
Chersonese (the Upland)?  The weight and strength of
our thousands will cause even proud Britain to rock
and reel, till, backward hurled across the plains,
vainly supported by lazy Turk and gassy French,
our artillery and wild horsemen will sweep you out
of existence.  With nothing to fall back upon except
the bleak sea-shores, your defeat will mean annihilation,
for you will die sword in hand, we doubt not.
The few of you who are taken prisoners will return
to your defeated and degraded nation sadder and
wiser men.  Your fate will be a lesson to the world,
and it is but the fate that God in his justice hangs
over all pirates and adventurers."
</p>

<p>
Sturdy laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Your parable of the stoat and the wild cat," he
said, "is not inapt.  But don't forget, my friend, that
we have Russia now by the neck just as the stoat
had the cat.  The stoat holds on; so shall we.  It is
life or death, for verily this is a war to the dagger's
hilt."
</p>

<p class="p3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
There was a good deal of blunt and honest truth
in what that Russian prisoner said; and even while
he spoke, the hordes of the enemy were coming down
on us from the north, and it would soon be decided
whether they or we should gain a battle, the loss of
which would be for them defeat, but for us disaster
and degradation as a nation.
</p>

<p>
There was much anxiety, nevertheless, on board
the <i>Gurnet</i>; for, laugh as Sturdy might at the bold,
almost bragging Russ, neither he nor any one else
could deny that the danger to our arms was now very
extreme.
</p>

<p>
"What will they say in England," said Captain
Gillespie to Sturdy a day or two after the Russian
had told them of the reinforcements pouring into the
Crimea from the north&mdash;"what will they say in
England if we are beaten?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, what indeed, sir?  But though the crisis is
coming, we'll get over it.  It really seems to me,
however, that we should smash Menschikoff and his
general Liprandi before the other army arrives."
</p>

<p>
Let us now return, to the field, reader.
</p>

<p>
If we take the Russian Todleben as our best
authority&mdash;and he was no mean one; very fair, I
think, though he does blab out truths that are not
over palatable to burly John Bull&mdash;the forces to be
marshalled against us at Mount Inkermann were most
formidable.
</p>

<p>
Listen.  The allies, including seamen and marines,
were barely 65,000; and Menschikoff had an army
of 115,000 to confront us with, not counting seamen.
</p>

<p>
Of the Russians who were actually engaged in the
great fight, General Soimonoff commanded 20,000
inside Sebastopol, and General Pauloff had 16,000 on
the hills above and beyond Tchernaya.  These would
combine, and independent of fifty guns in bastions
or batteries, they would have eighty or more field-guns.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the great force of Liprandi, that
we had hurled back from the valley of Balaklava,
which lay on the Fedioukine heights, from the hills
they had captured from the Turks to the Tchernaya
valley.
</p>

<p>
The Russians, therefore, had a terrible army, and
if praying could have done it, they would have
conquered us.
</p>

<p>
We prayed as much and probably as sincerely
as they did, though not with the same show and
ceremony.  God is the judge of what is right,
however, and He who heareth in secret can openly
reward.
</p>

<p>
A glance at the plan we have given will give
the reader a rough notion of the lie of the land
on which the memorable battle of Inkermann was
fought.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-296"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-296.jpg" alt="Plan of Inkermann area" />
</p>

<p>
Kinglake devotes a whole volume to a description
of the fight.  It is unlikely any one will read so
much about it.  The world moves far too fast, and
the coming of every fresh event obscures the memory
of those that went before.
</p>

<p>
Menschikoff's general orders were like the mist
that at one time of the morning enveloped the
land&mdash;somewhat hazy.  There was this much to be said for
them, however&mdash;each general was free to interpret
them as he pleased.  Whether this was to the
advantage of the cause is not so plain.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, Soimonoff and Pauloff were to lead the
main attacks, and Gortschakoff and Sebastopol were
to help and support.
</p>

<p>
But this wasn't quite all; for Menschikoff had not
left the former-named generals quite so free a hand
as what I have said may lead you to suppose.  These
two officers were ordered to <i>unite</i>, or effect a junction
as it is termed; and having done so, General
Dannenberg was to command the two.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Just three days before the battle, to his inexpressible
joy, Jack Mackenzie was sent on shore with an
escort of marines, including the sergeant, Paddy
O'Rayne, and the doctor himself, from Balaklava,
where the <i>Gurnet</i> had arrived.  Jack had to march
straight to head-quarters with a letter from Captain
Gillespie reporting the news he had heard of
the excessive business of the Russians up north, and
of the speed they were making to send along
reinforcements before the bad weather came on.
</p>

<p>
If the services of the marines and the two officers
were needed, they were to remain.
</p>

<p>
Jack had therefore an opportunity of once more
seeing the gallant 93rd, who were, as usual, spoiling
for a fight, and also taking a hurried luncheon in his
cousin's tent.
</p>

<p>
Balaklava had been temporarily fortified by Sir
Colin, in his own slap-dash but soldierly fashion.
</p>

<p>
"I hope," said Jack to Dr. Reikie, "that we won't be sent back."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure <i>I</i> won't be, man," said the doctor.  "I
fear, Jack, that surgeons will be more needed than
even middies."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, old man," said Jack, laughing; "we
middies may sometimes make work for doctors to do."
</p>

<p>
But neither Jack nor the surgeon and marines
were sent back&mdash;in truth, some of the red-jackets,
poor fellows, never went back&mdash;so that honest
Dr. Reikie, surgeon and naturalist, and his bold friend
Jack, burning for honour, glory, and epaulettes, were
present at the battle.
</p>

<p>
Now let me remind you that General Soimonoff
was inside Sebastopol with his army, and that his
orders were to issue therefrom near the mouth of the
Careenage glen or ravine (<a href="#img-296"><i>vide</i> plan</a>), and effect a
junction with Pauloff, who was to march his army
from the heights beyond Tchernaya, across the causeway
and the bridge over the river, and so meet and
unite with the former.  In fact, Menschikoff seemed
to have known very little at all about the chasm or
ravine with its inaccessible sides, and gave his orders
as if it hadn't existed.
</p>

<p>
As for our forces, we had the Second Division,
3,000 men, lying ready to meet the wild cat.  On the
Victoria ridge was Codrington's Brigade, and with it
marines&mdash;Dr. Reikie and Jack with his men both got
stationed here; near to them was the Naval Battery,
with its one gun&mdash;the others had been withdrawn
where they could be used in the siege-batteries.
</p>

<p>
Codrington's forces and the marines numbered only
1,500, or rather less.
</p>

<p>
About 1,000 yards to the rear of our Second
Division were the sturdy Guards, 1,400 or nearly.
</p>

<p>
Buller's Brigade stood on a slope adjoining
Codrington's, and the Third and Fourth Divisions were
on the heights behind our siege-batteries; while two
miles in the rear of the Second Division, Bosquet's
French troops were placed around the south and east
sides of the Upland.
</p>

<p>
Before day-dawn of this memorable fifth of November,
Soimonoff, disregarding altogether the orders to
join Pauloff, left Sebastopol, crossed the Careenage
Ravine, and climbing the northern heights of Mount
Inkermann, drew himself up in battle array.
</p>

<p>
Then the fight might have been said to commence.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE BATTLE OF INKERMANN&mdash;THE SOLDIERS OWN.
</h3>

<p>
"What a morning!" said Dr. Reikie to Jack
about six o'clock on the 5th.  "I can't
help thinking we'd just be as snug, and a wee bit
snugger, on board the old <i>Gurnet</i>.  We can hardly
see our neighbour's nose with the dark and the fog."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Jack, "as snug and snugger; but think
of the honour and glory."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother your honour and glory, let us have
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"What have you got in that jar, doctor&mdash;something
to eat?  Looks like a jelly-jar."
</p>

<p>
"And a jelly-jar it is, Jack, but you wouldn't care
to eat what's inside.  It's some rare specimens of the
Coleoptera,* Jack.  I spotted them ayont the hill last
night, so I just rubbed the inside of this jar with
butter, and stuck it in a bush.  I've now been to
fetch it, and it's about half full.  I'll show them to
you at breakfast."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Beetle tribe.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh no, thanks; not then."
</p>

<p>
"Beauties they are, I assure you, and prettily
bronzed; and some in uniform, you might say&mdash;in
navy-blue with gold and white facings."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, indeed; and this, it seems to me, is a
provision of nature to enliven the ghastly duty they
perform."
</p>

<p>
"Ghastly duty, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, just.  They bury the dead!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By this time Jack was nearly ready, and it was
almost daylight.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Dr. Reikie, you're wounded!"
</p>

<p>
The worthy surgeon's left arm was bound round
with a blood-stained handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's nothing.  When I was stooping down
and 'mooling' round the bush, a sentry hailed me.
I didn't know he was crying to me, and took no heed,
till bang went his rifle, and ower I went on my
hinder en'.  I wouldn't have cared for the skin wound,
Jack; but, man, the dashed bullet has torn the sleeve
of my best coat!  But come on; the specimens are
cheap at any price, and in Edinburgh
Museum&mdash;Listen! wasn't that a big gun?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, a big gun it was; and Soimonoff was at it
hammer and tongs.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Jack, come on," cried Reikie; "it's
quarters, I suppose.  And take my advice, just ram a
biscuit in your pocket; you may come over a hungry
hillock before darkening; but&mdash;there it goes again.
Why, old General Soonenough, or whatever his stupid
name is, must be jumbled in his judgment to begin
fighting before decent folk have their
breakfast.&mdash;Ah! here you come with my sword, Paddy.  Look,
lad, look; this is a jelly-jar.  Are you listening?"
</p>

<p>
"Troth am I, sorr.  A jaily-jar, ye said."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and it contains beautiful beetles all alive."
</p>

<p>
"All alive, sorr."
</p>

<p>
"Burial beetles, so you must keep them safe, and
not break the paper; for if they swarm out in your
pocket, Paddy, why, they'll bury you alive."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sorr; I'll take 'em, and if one of my
mates is killed, I'll give 'em to him.  Sure, sorr, it
won't matter much if a dead man is buried aloive.
But the grace o' God be about us, sorr, on this raw,
misty morning."
</p>

<p>
Soimonoff&mdash;or Soonenough, as Dr. Reikie called
him&mdash;with 300 skirmishers in front, came on in a line
of 6,000 men, supported by 3,000.  These covered
his batteries of twenty guns brought from the great
fortress, and they were soon posted on Shell Hill and
adjoining buttresses.  It was these large batteries
that opened fire about seven in the morning, their
guns reverberating from hill to hill.  The general's
lighter guns and 9,000 men came on behind his first
advance, which now began to descend from the higher
ground.
</p>

<p>
You will note, if you glance at the plan, that
a road goes on past the camp of the Second Division
to Quarry Ravine, which is nearly met at its head by
a portion or gully of Careenage Ravine.  This
naturally narrows the plateau above.  Here our pickets
had built a wall of loose stones between two copses,
and called it the Barrier.  Our pickets numbered
about 500, and were driven in; but Pennefather,
who commanded instead of Evans (sick), advanced to
their support, leaving the crest (plan) supported only
by a dozen guns and a body of infantry.
</p>

<p>
The fire of the Russian guns reached this crest, tore
through the camp in its rear, and killed men and
horses there.
</p>

<p>
On the narrow plateau, then, Soimonoff could not
advance with so broad a line, else he would have
attacked us all along our position.  His troops were
more or less massed therefore, and did not seem to
us so numerous.
</p>

<p>
One of his battalions attacked a wing of the 49th,
and were driven back in beautiful style, pell-mell,
almost to the slopes of Shell Hill.
</p>

<p>
Then the Russian general himself came on with
9,000 men, leading in person, and a column of sailors
advanced at the same time up the Careenage Ravine
itself, where of course the fog lay thickest.  Had we
been Russians attacked in this terrible position, I
don't hesitate to say we would have fled at once.
</p>

<p>
But Pennefather's force now amounted to 3,000
men and eighteen field-guns.
</p>

<p>
Let us take a look at the Russian sailors who are
coming up the ravine.  Their object was to get to
the plateau in our rear, and Heaven only knows how
things would have gone if they had succeeded, for
the masses of the enemy had already driven back the
88th near the crest.
</p>

<p>
But Buller himself arrived opportunely, and with
a company of the Guards and the 77th attacked this
ravine column so vigorously that it was driven back
and seen no more.
</p>

<p>
The battle now raged hot and terrible, the 47th
and 77th charging in beautiful style, and finally
driving two Russian battalions helter-skelter off the
field.  Other three battalions close by were
disheartened, and they too joined the rout.
</p>

<p>
General Soimonoff was killed, so his name will
bother us no more.  General Buller also had his horse
killed under him, and he himself was wounded, and
therefore placed <i>hors de combat</i>.
</p>

<p>
The other six battalions charged our centre, and
the battle continued for a time to rage along both
sides of the road leading to Quarry Ravine.  They
caught it hot also, and soon their ranks, sadly thinned,
were swept off the ground.
</p>

<p>
But where was the other general with the more
pronounceable name, Pauloff?  He was all too quickly
to the fore.  The broken and flying battalions of the
slain General Soimonoff had joined Pauloff's first
eight battalions at the head of the Quarry Ravine,
and had formed in front of our right, their own right
being across the road there, and their left on what
was called the Sand-bag Battery.  This was a battery
that had been thrown up by General Evans in opposition
to one that the Russians had constructed after
the twenty-sixth of October.  It had a parapet and
two embrasures of sand-bags.  But after having
unshipped the enemy's guns, ours had been taken away.
Well, this "Sand-bag Battery" was to-day the centre
of terrible conflict, and was taken and retaken about
half a dozen times in all.
</p>

<p>
As Pauloff's regiment on the right advanced towards
the Barrier, one of the grandest and hottest
charges of the day was made by the 30th.  They
were but 200 in all, but leaped the Barrier and dashed
into the advancing foe, and although we had officers
and men cut down&mdash;too many, alas!&mdash;the Russian
regiment was hurled back towards Shell Hill and
down the Quarry glen.
</p>

<p>
Then the other regiments were attacked with vim
and vigour; the end of this part of the battle being
the utter rout of Pauloff's army of 15,000 by little
more than 3,000 dashing Englishmen.
</p>

<p>
Pauloff might easily have been excused for believing
after this that our gallant fellows had large
supports behind them.
</p>

<p>
A new battle, however, may be said to have
begun at half-past seven o'clock, when General
Dannenberg himself arrived.  Pauloff's army was soon
swelled again to 19,000.
</p>

<p>
Ours had been reinforced by the Guards, by men
from the First Division batteries, and by Cathcart
with 2,000 men from the siege works.  But those
troops of ours that had so bravely defended the
Barrier had to fall back, overpowered by force of
numbers.  The Russians, however, were soon
dislodged by the 63rd, the 21st, and Rifles.  Ten
thousand of Pauloff's troops now attacked our centre,
Dannenberg himself assuming full command.
</p>

<p>
Dannenberg's first attack was on Adams, against
whose poor brave 700 no less than 4,000 troops
were hurled.  The fight was desperate, the enemy
now rushing on like demons.  It raged about the
slopes of the Fore Ridge and Sand-bag Battery.  The
Guards rushed now from the crest to the support of
Adams, and again and again were the Russians hurled
backwards with fearful slaughter; our fellows, however,
not pursuing, but standing on the defensive, till
back rushed the foe, only to meet further repulse and
greater slaughter.
</p>

<p>
But when Cathcart came up, things assumed a
different aspect; for this brave man, though possessed
now of only 400 men&mdash;the rest being lent, so to speak,
here and there over the field wherever needed&mdash;descended
the slope to the right, and took the offensive.
At first his attack was successful, and the enemy
fled in confusion.  But, alas! it ended in disaster;
for a body of Russians had broken through our
front, and descended on him from the very height
he had quitted.  His brave little corps was scattered,
and only returned fighting in groups against fearful
odds, and strewing the ground with their dead and
wounded.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  Cathcart himself was among the slain.
</p>

<p>
This part of the battle ended in a series of
independent fights, which broke our line of continuity,
and enabled the Russians for a time to occupy the
Fore Ridge.  A French regiment came now to the
rescue, outflanked the enemy, and drove them back.
</p>

<p>
But another terrible attack was soon made by the
persistent foe.
</p>

<p>
Once more their great guns, about a hundred in all,
ploughed the crest with shot and shell; once more
our centre was attacked by the columns that rushed
up from the Quarry Ravine.  And this fight was the
most desperate of all.
</p>

<p>
For a time the Russians were so far successful
that they not only took and occupied the crest, but
drove our troops back from the head of Careenage
Ravine, capturing and spiking some of our guns.
</p>

<p>
The main column of the Russians meanwhile came
on after, and passing our troops at the Barrier,
hurried on to support their front lines.  But these had
been driven back by the French, and so the main
body had to encounter victors.
</p>

<p>
Bloody and terrible was the stand the foe made,
however, and fearful were the losses they encountered.
They reeled, they struggled, and finally fell back.
</p>

<p>
For a time after this the fight raged all about the
head of the Quarry Ravine and Sand-bag Battery, and
once the French themselves were all but beaten, and
lost ground.  They were reinforced in time, however,
and soon after this the battle was in a measure
decided.  We got bigger guns to bear now upon Shell
Hill, and a great artillery fight took place.  This and
a daring attack by our infantry caused Dannenberg
to retreat at last.  And neither our troops nor those
of the French were in a position to follow up his
retreat.
</p>

<p>
So ended this bloody battle: Dannenberg sullenly
retiring; the allies too weak, too exhausted to follow
up their victory by a final and triumphant charge.
</p>

<p>
They say that so utterly worn out were our brave
fellows, and the French as well, that no wild spirit of
exultation followed victory; and when the gloaming
of that sad day fell upon the field of battle, there was
little to break the silence&mdash;now that the enemy had
fled back to the great fortress&mdash;save the mournful
moaning of the wounded.
</p>

<p>
The carnage on this field was fearful, especially all
about the Fore Ridge and between that and the cliffs,
where we are told the dead lay in swathes.  So
numerous were they that it was difficult to walk, far
less to ride, through these lines without stumbling
over the bodies of the slain.
</p>

<p>
The Russians lost altogether 256 officers and
12,000 men in killed and wounded.  We lost in
killed 597 officers and men, and had nearly 2,000
wounded.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The battle of Inkermann may well be called the
soldiers' own battle, for never before, perhaps, since
the days of old was there so much hand-to-hand
fighting, and so much display of courage and determination
both in officers and in men, individually, in
small groups, and shoulder to shoulder in line.
</p>

<p>
I wish I had space in which to speak and tell you
of the many deeds of valour done this day single-handed.
I shall&mdash;because I must&mdash;resist the temptation
to do so, merely adding that nowhere in the open
field, either in regiments or single-handed, did the
Russians prove themselves any match for the British,
and God grant they never may.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Long after nightfall our doctors were busy indeed.
Our own wounded must first be seen to, and then
those of the enemy&mdash;for the British are ever merciful.
Neither Jack nor Dr. Reikie nor Paddy O'Rayne was
wounded; and although the worthy Scotch surgeon's
arm was stiff and painful, hardly did he close an eye
that night, so much had he to do.  Jack and O'Rayne
both helped him, but sank at last with exhaustion, so
Reikie plodded on in his good work until day began
to dawn.  Nature would be resisted no longer, and
the poor fellow fell asleep on the battle-field itself.
He did not wake for hours.
</p>

<p>
O'Rayne and Jack had both been searching for him.
</p>

<p>
"An' sure here you are at last, sorr.  Troth, I
thought it was dade entoirely you were."
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right," said Dr. Reikie, sitting up and
rubbing his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And it's as plazed as the pigs we both are, sorr,
for that same.  Sure we belaved some wounded
Russian had kilt you."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie got up now and gave himself a bit of a
shake as a collie dog might have done.  That was
all his toilet.
</p>

<p>
"Paddy," he cried, "I forgot to ask you what about
the specimens."
</p>

<p>
"I kaipt them for you, sorr, as safe as the apple av
me eye.  And here they are, sorr, if they're any use
to you to bury the dead."

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE AWFUL GALE&mdash;IN CAMP BEFORE SEBASTOPOL&mdash;LETTERS<br />
FROM HOME.
</h3>

<p>
Few, if any, of our Crimean heroes are likely to
forget the terrible gale of hurricane force that
came raging from the south on the fourteenth day of
November.
</p>

<p>
Jack Mackenzie and Dr. Reikie were still stationed
on shore, where they were to remain till the close of
the war.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> had been to Varna on special duty&mdash;luckily
for her&mdash;and just one day at sea on her return
voyage, when early in the morning it came on to
blow.  It was Sturdy's watch at the time, and even at
six bells it was dark&mdash;dark, and dirty as well; and
several times when the lieutenant looked at his watch
by the glimmer of the binnacle lamp, he thought it
must surely have stopped.  It was cold too, bitterly
cold; and though it had fallen calm about the middle
watch, it now began to blow again, while a weight
seemed to lie on the cloud-laden air that oppressed
every one on board.  The glass, too, boded no good;
and not knowing what might happen, the lieutenant
thought it his duty, even before calling Mr. Fitzgerald
and his watch, to close-reef top-sails and set a storm-jib.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he done so before the hurricane came
down on the ship, with a force that for a time seemed
to threaten her with destruction.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy himself could not remember ever being
afloat in a more terrible storm.  And the strength of
it had come on with the suddenness of a white squall in
the Indian Ocean.  For a short time he tried to keep
the course, but speedily found that the best thing he
could do was to lie to.  The <i>Gurnet</i>, however, was a
strong little craft, and so long as there was plenty of
sea-room neither Captain Gillespie nor his lieutenant
feared anything.
</p>

<p>
Considering everything, the vessel was not driven
so far out of her course after all, nor had steam been
got up until the violence of the cyclone&mdash;for cyclone
it was&mdash;had passed away.
</p>

<p>
Just two days after this the <i>Gurnet</i> was at anchor
near Balaklava harbour, and her officers then found
that the destruction caused by the storm was fearful
to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> could scarcely have made her way into
the harbour itself, had it been desirable to do so, owing
to the quantities of wreckage that floated about and
filled it.  Even when Sturdy landed on duty, the boat
had a difficulty in getting through.  It was pitiful to
see those boxes of stores, but above all the trusses
of hay&mdash;irretrievably damaged by the salt water&mdash;floating
in the sea.  Sturdy got news of the storm
here in Balaklava before he went on to the front.  Of
ships or vessels of one sort and another no less than
twenty-one had been wrecked, and ten more damaged.
The saddest thing of all was the total destruction of
the fine steamer <i>Prince</i>, which was laden with a
splendid cargo of everything that could be of use to
our poor troops in enabling them to stand the rigours
of the winter as they lay before Sebastopol.  Stores of
ammunition too were lost.
</p>

<p>
So much for the destruction of life and valuables
along the shore.  But when our good lieutenant at
last found himself on the Upland and near our
camps, he opened his eyes in astonishment.  Here
were misery and wretchedness past description.  I said
"near our camps," but near to the places where our
camps had been would be more in accordance with
facts.
</p>

<p>
The wind and the rain together had weighted and
blown down the tents in every direction; scattered
them wholesale, indeed, in every direction.  Neither
food, fire, nor shelter therefore remained for the men.
Poor fellows who had been working in the trenches
returned tired and weary, to lie down, hungry and
cold, literally in the mud and slush.
</p>

<p>
Snow, too, had fallen, to make matters worse, and
ground that had been hard and solid before was now
little better than a mire.
</p>

<p>
The first to meet Sturdy after his return from the
general's quarters was Dr. Reikie, and with him was
his servant Paddy O'Rayne.
</p>

<p>
"Why," cried the doctor in his broadest Doric, "wha
wad hae thocht o' seein' you here, Sturdy man?  A
sicht o' you is guid for sair een [sore eyes]."
</p>

<p>
"I know you are tired, poor Auld Reikie," said
Sturdy as they shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"What way that, man?"
</p>

<p>
"Because when you're tired you always talk broad
Scotch; secondly, because you don't seem to have
shaved for a week; and thirdly, because you're as
dirty as any old tramp."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! goodness help us, Sturdy," replied the doctor,
"it is tramp, tramp all day and all night here.  I
haven't had my shoes off since the hurricane, nor poor
Paddy here either; and as for Jack, he's working in
the trenches now with the naval brigade at the big
guns.  And when he comes back, after he has a
mouthful of food, he just sets to and helps me.  Man,
it's a comfort to have friends around you in a time
like this.  Look, see, I've got the hospital tents a
kind of rigged again.  But, dear Sturdy, I declare
that if I were to tell you one-half of what my poor
sick and wounded have suffered these last two or
three days, it would bring tears to your eyes, rough
old sea-dog though you are."
</p>

<p>
"Terrible!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay is it, Sturdy.  Myself and the other doctors
were getting a nice lot of things stored away for
the patients.  But, man, the tents were blown down,
and the food and stores and lint and bandages all
destroyed.  When we got the tents off the creatures,
we found dozens dead in bed; and from the rest,
with their poor wounded limbs and necks and heads,
the very blankets were torn by the strength of the
gale.  Sturdy, my friend, it's the truth I tell you:
only those of the wounded that are deid and awa'
[dead and gone] are to be envied.  I won't ask you
to come to the hospital, the sichts are far ower
sickenin'.  Talk o' the glory o' war!  Man, it's
yonder under those drippin' tents you could see all
its ghastliness."
</p>

<p>
"And is cholera still raging?"
</p>

<p>
Reikie pointed to a wretched apology for a tent at
some distance from the rest.
</p>

<p>
"Look for yoursel', Sturdy."
</p>

<p>
Two and two in single file, each pair with a ghastly
burden between them, fully eighteen men were marching
away from the camp.
</p>

<p>
"It's burial-time, that's all," said Reikie, then
abruptly changed the subject.  "Do you see those
men yonder scattering themselves over the Upland?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and they don't seem unhappy.  Where are
they off to?"
</p>

<p>
"They are going to dig roots for fuel, then light
their fires if they can.  They are running to keep
themselves warm; they are laughing and chaffing to
keep up each other's hearts.  Ah! there are no
soldiers like the British."
</p>

<p>
"Poor beggars!" said Sturdy, "Why, we were
never so badly off as that even at sea, Reikie."
</p>

<p>
"Well, how we are to get through the dismal
winter the good Lord only knows, my friend."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Things grew ten times worse in the British camps
before very long.
</p>

<p>
I have no desire to draw a harrowing picture of
the sufferings of our soldiers and sailors, but the
reader should know a little of what war is at its
worst.  Though most of the poor men that languished
in pain and misery through the next two or three
months before Sebastopol are dead and gone, one feels
pity even now when thinking of their wretchedness,
and one feels burning with anger also to think that
the greater part of all they underwent might have
been prevented by ordinary care and good management
on the part of those who held the reins of
authority at home.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy paid another visit to the front in December.
Again he met Reikie, but this time in Balaklava, and
with him were Jack Mackenzie, and a few marines to
carry back stores.  Both the surgeon and Jack had
burdens to bear.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jack, "how do we look this time?"
</p>

<p>
"You look old and worn, Jack, I assure you.  I'm
sorry for you.  How about your honour and glory, lad?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-332"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-332.jpg" alt="&quot;Maggie!&quot;--&quot;Jack!&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;Maggie!&quot;&mdash;&quot;Jack!&quot;
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head somewhat sadly, then burst
into a merry laugh.
</p>

<p>
"O Mr. Sturdy, that is all to come.  At present,
I must admit, we are just pretty miserable, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, your cheeks look pretty hollow, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"The best proof that I can give you," said Jack,
"that we are not living in clover is, that the doctor
here has ceased to look for specimens in his idle
moments."
</p>

<p>
"Idle moments!" laughed the surgeon.  "A lot of
those we have.  O Jack, Jack, I believe you would
have your joke if we were taking you to the grave
to bury you.&mdash;Been down for stores," he continued,
in reply to a question of Sturdy's.  "Yes, Sturdy,
I've had to fight, too, for all I've got.  But, man, the
suffering of my poor fellows is so dreadful that&mdash;hang
me if I wouldn't steal for them."
</p>

<p>
It wasn't often that honest Reikie made use of a
questionable word; and as the tears stood in his eyes
as he spoke, I think we must forgive him.
</p>

<p>
"I've been giving it to the fellows here all round,"
he added, "right and left, but I don't think it did
much good."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mr. Sturdy, it did no good, because it was all
in broad Scotch."
</p>

<p>
"I'd no time to speak English.  But, dear Sturdy,
I could save hundreds, and the other doctors more, if
we had only medical comforts and stores.  Man, it
would draw tears from a nether millstone to hear
the poor fellows beggin' for a little soup or sago.
Jack can tell you of the sufferings his men undergo
in the trenches.  My place is with the sick."
</p>

<p>
"And mine too," said Paddy O'Rayne.  "And it's
meself that belaves that my master here is killing
himself for the want av slape, sorr, and I wish you'd
spake to him.  Faith, it would be the sorrowful day
for us all if he was kilt entoirely.  As for staling,
sorr," he added, "I've tried it meself, so the surgeon
shouldn't soil his sleeves."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," laughed Reikie, "I must say that Paddy
does find a bit on the sly sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Thrue for you, doctor, sorr; but it isn't always
stolen it is.  There was the other day, you know,
when just across the lines that pony was shot with
a bit of a shell: who had a better roight than our
patients to it?  But sure the loife was barely out av
the baste when he was surrounded wid Frenchies, and
if I hadn't learned to twirl a good shillalah in ould
Oirland, it's sorra a hind leg av that pony I'd have
had at all.  'Git off wid ye,' I cried, 'ye durty
frog-atin' spalpeens!'  They didn't understand a word I
said; but troth they felt the whacks all the same.
Well, sorr, as I was staggerin' back wid my beautiful
hind leg av pony, who should I meet but a squad o'
blue-jackets.  'Hullo, Paddy!' says one, 'down wid
your leg; it's share and share alike.'  But bless you,
sorr, when I tould them the mate wasn't for myself
at all, and that I'd just been after staling the leg av
a horse to make a drop av beef-tea for the sick,
sure they left in a body, and wouldn't have touched a
morsel to save their lives; and it's nothing but the
blessed truth I'm telling you, sorr."
</p>

<p>
"Talking about horses, Sturdy," said Reikie, "man,
their sufferings are terrible!  I don't think there
are five hundred alive in the camp now, and these
are only kept together by their skins.  They used to
have to come all the way down here for forage; but
now if there was forage for them they couldn't carry
it.  We've had frost and snow on the Upland, and
after every extra cold night, Sturdy, we have extra
bodies to bury next day, both men and horses."
</p>

<p>
"And it's never a burial the horses get ayther," said
Paddy, "and never a much the men, poor, dear sowls."
</p>

<p>
"But here come our fellows with the scanty stores,"
said Reikie.&mdash;"Now, Jack, we're ready for the march."
</p>

<p>
On their way up they were met by Llewellyn and
a party of Highlanders returning from the army
head-quarters, where they had been with biscuit.
</p>

<p>
Llewellyn halted his men, and gave the doctor and
his party a hearty welcome.
</p>

<p>
It would have been difficult to say which looked in
the sorrier plight, Jack's marines or Llewellyn's
Highlanders.  Both had high cheek-bones now, telling of
want of sleep and scanty fare; but many had cheeks
that were touched with a hectic flush, eyes all too
bright, and the ringing cough that spoke of fever
within.  Death had already marked them for his
victims.  But Death had been so busy of late that
he hardly knew where to turn.
</p>

<p>
The Highlanders' legs were red and bleeding round
and above the knees.  When a kilt gets wet, the
greater part of the moisture sinks to the lower part;
and when this is frozen, it always cuts.  Their shoes
or boots were holed, their stockings too, and some
had bare cut feet bound round with rags.
</p>

<p>
But during the short time that the two parties
halted, the privates became very friendly, and food
was freely "swapped" for morsels of tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"So you see," said Llewellyn, "my Highlanders are
pack-horses now.  We carry siege material as well as
biscuit and food; for, Mr. Sturdy, we are going to
have another go at the Russians before long.  The
Redan and Barrack Battery are both to be taken in
fine style."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wish you luck, Llewellyn."
</p>

<p>
"It is fighting we want," said the young soldier.
"Bother it all, our fellows might as well have stayed
at home and ploughed the fields, as come here to play
at being pack-horses and shore porters."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye till we meet."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Jack and his party were some distance off, when
Llewellyn ran after them.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, old cousin," he said, "a mail-boat has just
come in; I've seen the signal.  Now for letters from
home."
</p>

<p>
I think the news with which Jack's cousin had
hurried after them lightened every heart in that little
party, and so they struggled on, talking gaily enough
till they reached the Upland.  Sturdy insisted on
carrying his share of the medical stores; and indeed
he was the hardiest and strongest man of the lot.
</p>

<p>
The road to-day, Dr. Reikie told the lieutenant,
was even less cut up and sticky than usual.  "Sometimes,
man," he said, "the mud is so deep and tenacious
that it sucks the very boots off the poor soldiers'
feet&mdash;a perfect quagmire."
</p>

<p>
On their way to the front, Sturdy, hardy sailor
though he was, was sickened at the horrible sights he
saw on each side of the road.  There were men lying
there whom it was impossible for the time to assist,
struck down with cholera or dysentery on their way
back with their bundles from Balaklava.
</p>

<p>
There were horses dying, horses dead, skeletons of
bullocks, some wholly exposed, some half buried, and
here and there skeletons even of men, protruding
from their all too shallow graves; and although the
winter air to-day was crisp and keen, and snow lay
on the hillocks that had not been trodden, the stench
that filled the air was at times almost unbearable.
</p>

<p>
Pitiable sight, too, were the Turks whom they met,
and who salaamed as they passed, albeit they were
carrying their dead on stretchers, or even on their
backs, to be buried in one common grave down near
to Balaklava.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Sturdy, at his own request, was permitted to spend
a few days in camp and in the trenches, so he soon
found out something of the terrible life our poor
fellows had to endure there.
</p>

<p>
Badly fed, clothed in rags, with at night scarcely
a blanket to cover them from the rain or melting
snow, that poured in through the tattered tents;
hardly any fuel; no means of cooking their scanty
rations; on night duty or day duty, on the march, or
under fire in the drains called trenches,&mdash;was it any
wonder that even those who were not killed or
wounded were dying day by day, like braxied sheep,
as Dr. Reikie put it?
</p>

<p>
I am glad, indeed, to drop the curtain over this
part of my story, for horrors like these are but little
to my taste.
</p>

<p>
The scene changed as far as our principal heroes
were concerned, when one evening Reikie met Sturdy.
</p>

<p>
He had a letter in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"We are off," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Who are off, and off what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, your ship is ordered to Scutari, with a cargo
of sick for hospital there.  I am going in charge
of them.  <i>You</i> are ordered to join the <i>Gurnet</i> at
once, and I myself have ordered Jack to come
with us."
</p>

<p>
"Jack isn't sick?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but Jack has been working too hard, and he
isn't well, so I've recommended the change."
</p>

<p>
The transport of the sick and wounded to Balaklava
was in itself a sad and terrible picture.
</p>

<p>
I do not know whether it would not have been
even more humane to permit them to die in the mud
of the hospital tents.
</p>

<p>
Sturdy shuddered as he looked at those poor mummies
of men, that were gently lifted in their blankets
and placed on horseback&mdash;the poor horses themselves
staggering under the weight.
</p>

<p>
There was little complaining heard from the pallid
sufferers: many seemed even dying as they were
hoisted to the backs of the steeds.
</p>

<p>
Some moaned, others showed by their faces that
they were suffering agonies of pain; and although
their messmates were as gentle with them as if they
had been sick infants, every now and then one could
hear such expressions as&mdash;"Gently, Jack, gently!"
"Mind my leg, Bill!"  "Yes; now I'm easier, thanks,
thanks!"
</p>

<p>
These last words were indeed spoken by a poor
soldier of the 77th, whose head drooped back the
very next moment&mdash;the man was dead.
</p>

<p>
The march to Balaklava of Dr. Reikie's detachment
of sick was far more sad than any funeral
procession ever seen.
</p>

<p>
The movements of the horses, gingerly though the
poor wise brutes tried to step, as if sensible of the
weary load they had to bear, caused the wounded to
moan and groan; but many lay with closed eyes as if
dead, while others, horrible to relate, were attacked by
fits of wild delirium on the march, and had to be
held down by force.
</p>

<p>
Then the horses often slipped, and more than one fell.
</p>

<p>
As gently as possible the men were lifted off on
their arrival at Balaklava, and conveyed on board the
<i>Gurnet</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here Reikie made them all as comfortable as
circumstances would permit.
</p>

<p>
But do not think, reader, that their sufferings were
ameliorated when the <i>Gurnet</i>, after considerable delay,
got off to sea.  No, it was increased tenfold; for these
sick were packed on the decks side by side, with
hardly room for the attendants to step between.
</p>

<p>
Alas! the attendance they got was but little,
though every one, from the doctor downwards, tried
to do what they could for them.
</p>

<p>
To their other miseries were added all the horrors
of sea-sickness; for a storm had come on, and although
the vessel was under steam, she made all too little
headway.  She shipped seas at times, or the spray
dashing inboard cold and white soaked the wretched
patients to the skin.
</p>

<p>
Next day, however, the sea went down, and the
sun shone out; but many were dead, and with scant
ceremony and short service were lowered over the
side, to float or sink, for there was no shot that could
be spared to carry them to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Scutari at last!
</p>

<p>
The word passed from mouth to mouth along the
decks, and the poor fellows who heard it smiled in
hopefulness.  Now they would have rest, they
believed; now they would be safe, and soon get well.
Then ships would bear them back once more to their
own far-off homes in well-beloved England.
</p>

<p>
But for Jack that name Scutari had a charm it
could possess for none of the others.
</p>

<p>
Those letters from home had brought good news to
many, but to no one more than to Jack Mackenzie.
For his sister, whom he had not seen for so many
long years, was coming out to Scutari as a nurse.
His mother, too, was well, and so were his cousins
and Uncle Tom.
</p>

<p>
There was also a precious little missive from Violet&mdash;that
is Tottie.  Well, I should not like to call it
a love-letter.  What do little girls of twelve know
about such a thing as love, except for ice-cream and
chocolate drops?  This letter was not even grammatical,
the spelling was somewhat original, and the caligraphy
just anyhow.  But Jack&mdash;well, I won't tell
you.
</p>

<p>
Then there was that letter from Drumglen, so
orthodox, so prim, that, as he read it, the old grandam
herself seemed to be sitting there before our hero
in her high-backed chair.  But the letter was
affectionate enough for all that; so on the whole Jack
was happy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE HORRORS OF SCUTARI.
</h3>

<p>
When Maggie Mackenzie, then barely twenty
years of age, volunteered to go out to Scutari
to nurse the sick and the wounded, in company
with many other ladies, some young and others not
quite so young, little did she think or know of all she
would see, suffer, and endure.  But she was a brave
Scotch lassie, and, as she phrased it herself, "having
once taken hold of the plough, she had no intention
of looking back."
</p>

<p>
All the ladies who had gone out, however, were not
so determined.  Many had left their homes for the
very romance of the thing, others from mere sentiment
or to gain notoriety; but the few had gone to
do all the good they could, and&mdash;all honour to
them&mdash;did it.
</p>

<p>
It is quite unnecessary to say a single word about
the soldiers' guardian angel, Miss Nightingale.  It
was under her immediate generalship that Maggie and
the others were placed when they first reached Scutari.
Every Board School boy has heard the name of this
hospital.  It had originally been a large barrack, but
was given up by the Turks for a hospital.  At first,
and long after Maggie went there, it was in a condition
the very reverse of sanitary, and the scenes and
suffering within its walls are past all chance of
description.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, however, as the winter wore on, Miss
Nightingale's sway was less controlled, and great
improvements were made in every way; especially,
perhaps, in the cookery for the sick.
</p>

<p>
Maggie Mackenzie was well established in her
quarters&mdash;and, indeed, they were very humble, and
contained not a vestige of furniture that was
indispensable.  Nevertheless, the room, which she shared
with another young lady, was in a tower; therefore it
had one advantage&mdash;namely, fresh air.  The view from
the two windows, when these amateur nurses had a
moment to spare to look at it, was very beautiful
indeed, looking up the Bosphorus and towards romantic
Constantinople&mdash;romantic only at a distance.  The
room was even reasonably quiet, except at early
morning, when the strange sound of the muezzins'
call for prayer fell upon the ear; but this had no
disturbing effect, rather quite the reverse.
</p>

<p>
In coming out to Scutari, Maggie had roughed
it&mdash;rather, she roughed it in landing; and here the
troubles of herself and the other sisters only seemed
to begin, and they were chiefly of a domestic character.
Women folks like to be tidy and clean in their
dresses and apartments, so very much shocked indeed
they were to find that insects of various kinds, some
unmentionable, were everywhere, and that rats and
mice were so tame that they not only persisted in
sharing the ladies' rooms, but looked upon the ladies
as intruders.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless Maggie soon schooled herself to look
upon all these troubles as part and parcel of her
present not enviable existence.  "Never mind," she
told herself over and over again; "I am doing some good."
</p>

<p>
Then she would sigh as she thought of the awful
tide of human misery and wretchedness that rolled
in and out of this great hospital every day under her
eyes, and which she could do so little to stem.
</p>

<p>
The tide that rolled in was that which brought the
sick and the wounded from the seat of war; that
which rolled out was more solemn than sad, for it
carried on its bosom the dead that were borne away
to their long homes in this foreign land.
</p>

<p>
Just think of it, reader: nearly one hundred of
our poor fellows breathed their last in this huge and
comfortless hospital daily; and day after day, we are
told, the sick were carried in faster than the dead
were carried out!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Maggie!"
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
Yes, Jack had come; and I do think it was not
altogether tears of joy that his sister was now
shedding.  In fact, that fit of weeping did Maggie a
deal of good.  She had had much need of it before
now, but never any excuse to indulge in so sweet an
extravagance.
</p>

<p>
"Come into our drawing-room, Jack," she said at
last; "and you also, Dr. Reikie.  We are no strangers,
you know, doctor; I have heard so much about you."
</p>

<p>
"Drawing-room!" thought Jack.  "Why, sister
must be better off than I had imagined.  I wonder
if she has a Turkey carpet and a piano."
</p>

<p>
They went upstairs.  A big deal door opened into
a portion of the corridor partitioned off, and used as
a kind of <i>omniorum</i> storehouse.  A curtain was now
pulled back, and lo! Jack and Reikie found
themselves in Maggie's drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
A rickety old table, surely on its last legs, bales
and boxes and barrels, did duty as seats and
furniture; but there was a sofa, and to this Maggie
pointed, and Jack and Reikie sat down, and felt as
if they had come to anchor on a bagful of broken
saucepans.
</p>

<p>
But there was a delightful window to this room,
looking away over the dark-blue Sea of Marmora.
</p>

<p>
"This is Sister Mary," said Maggie, introducing a
tall, dark lady, who was sitting in a corner busily
mending a pair of soldier's stockings.
</p>

<p>
Mary bowed and smiled, and would have left the
room had Maggie permitted her, which she would not.
</p>

<p>
Then what a long, delightful talk they all had
about home and old times!  And what a number of
questions had to be asked and answered, only those
who have been in a somewhat similar position could
believe or understand.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie got up at last.
</p>

<p>
"No, Jack," he said; "don't you leave for a short
time.  I'm going on duty, and to have a look round
the wards.  I'll call for you shortly.  What I shall
see, Jack, would not interest although it might
horrify you."
</p>

<p>
Jack Mackenzie gladly stayed behind with his
sister, who was at that time off duty.
</p>

<p>
"Wards" Dr. Reikie had called the chambers where
lay the sick and wounded.  This was for courtesy's
sake, perhaps, for they really were long halls or
corridors.  The doctor had seen many a hospital,
he had done duty at Malta and in Haslar at home,
but never had he seen anything approaching to the
horrors he now witnessed in those abodes of misery,
pain, gloom, despair, and death.
</p>

<p>
Those poor soldiers lay in two long rows almost
side by side, the feet of one row to the feet of the
other, with a passage for doctor and nurse between.
</p>

<p>
Cap in hand, and accompanied by an army surgeon,
he walked silently along corridor after corridor.
</p>

<p>
Oh the horror and the sorrow of it!  Oh the agony
and the anguish displayed on nearly every second face,
when it could be seen! for some were so swathed
in bandages and plasters that nothing was visible
save the mouth and the sunken eyes.  Here and
there were patients who groaned&mdash;at times some of
these started in shrieking terror and delirium; but,
for the most part, they lay still and silent, and
grateful for the slightest comfort or sympathizing
word.
</p>

<p>
Many of them had been stricken down with dysentery;
others were plague-stricken, with pinched, blue,
contracted features, and cold, thin hands, like claws
of birds&mdash;moribund; and others, again, were dead
and stiff.
</p>

<p>
If anything could add to the horror of this terrible
scene, it was the sickening odour that permeated
every nook and corner of the hospital.  Dr. Reikie,
although he stopped here and there to inquire kindly
how some of his own patients felt, and to give them
a few words of hope and consolation, was himself glad
when he stood once more in the open air; his heart
was sore and sad to think that many of the poor
fellows, now so low and sick unto death, had been
among the bravest of the brave in action and the
merriest of the merry around the camp-fire.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
For nearly a fortnight the <i>Gurnet</i> lay here; and
although it was meant to be a kind of health-holiday
for both Jack and himself, neither was idle.
</p>

<p>
Yet every day the two friends found time to visit
the hospital; and when at last the time of final
departure came round, poor Maggie treated herself
once more to a hearty cry as she bade her brother
adieu.
</p>

<p>
Neither he nor honest Reikie went away empty-handed;
for Maggie and Sister Mary had managed to
knit three pairs of warm stockings for them, although
to do so they had to work even at the bedsides of
the patients.
</p>

<p>
I have said nothing at all about one other part of
this great barrack-hospital into which it had been
Dr. Reikie's privilege to have a peep.  This was the
ward or wards set apart for the wives of soldiers
who had been permitted to come to the Black Sea
with their husbands.  The wretchedness, suffering,
and misery of these poor women could never be
graphically told.  They are dead and gone long ago,
so what need is there to resuscitate even the memory
of the agonies they endured?
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The <i>Gurnet</i> was less crowded on her return voyage
to Balaklava, for few, indeed, of the men or officers
sent to Scutari ever went back.  If they did not die,
they were invalided home.
</p>

<p>
The ship was detained for some time by contrary
winds, Captain Gillespie being desirous of saving his
precious coals; for the winter was severe enough on
the Upland, and fuel so scarce that well did coals
merit the name of black diamonds.
</p>

<p>
But though the sea was rough and the breezes
keen and cold, every hour on the ocean seemed to
strengthen both Jack and Dr. Reikie; and when they
once more landed at Balaklava, they felt men again
in every sense of the word.
</p>

<p>
In hardship and in suffering, then, did the weary
winter of 1854-55 drag on.  But meanwhile, both
by the besieged and the besiegers, the great game of
war was being steadily and steadfastly played; and
our poor men, now reduced in numbers by cold, by
famine, wounds, and pestilence, to little over 11,000,
were never out of danger from bullet-shot and shell.
</p>

<p>
The war was even carried on underground, and
mines were met by counter-mines; by sorties of the
enemy too, which, however, were repulsed with great
slaughter.  The Russians, moreover, succeeded in
pushing out their works beyond their trenches, and the
allied armies extended their lines, till they almost met.
</p>

<p>
The war, indeed, seemed to wax more determined
and bitter as the time flew by.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
PELISSIER TO THE FRONT&mdash;DEATH OF LORD RAGLAN.
</h3>

<p>
"The king is dead!  Long live the king!"
</p>

<p>
Yes, the proud and ambitious Emperor
Nicholas breathed his last on the second of March
1855, and Alexander the Second reigned in his stead.
I do not mean to judge the dead emperor harshly, as
many have done.  <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> is an
excellent motto; but, independent of this, I cannot but
believe that in endeavouring <i>vi et armis</i> to cut his
way to the sunny Mediterranean, Nicholas was following
the traditional policy of his forbears, and that he
believed he was doing the best he could for his country.
</p>

<p>
The emperor probably died half heart-broken: the
victories not only of our troops and those of the
French in the Crimea, but of the Turks, who in
February drove the Russians from the gates of
Eupatoria, had told upon his health; even the winter,
with its hardships, its diseases, its death, had not
annihilated our armies, and hope itself seemed to desert
the heart of the great Czar.  Heigh-ho! death is no
respecter of persons; but even in the last moments
of his life, Nicholas found strength to send a message
to his troops.  He was passing away into life eternal,
but even from on high he would bend down to bless
his warriors for their unequalled constancy and valour!
</p>

<p>
If any one expected that the war would now cease,
he was much mistaken; for Alexander was as
determined as his father had been.
</p>

<p>
But a few months more and summer would be in
its prime and glory, the roads would no longer be
sealed against the influx of troops, and the allied
armies would be crushed out of existence and driven
into the sea by sheer force of numbers, Sebastopol
relieved, and victory won.
</p>

<p>
Well, this would certainly have been for us a
national disaster of the gravest kind, and for the
French also; but would it have put an end to the
war?  Would we, because the Crimea was lost, have
stood quietly by and seen the northern Bear establish
himself at Constantinople, complacently licking his
paws as he saw his ships of war pass majestically to
or from the Mediterranean?  Undoubtedly not.  The
relief of Sebastopol by the Russians, and our destruction
on the Upland, would have been but the
commencement of a greater war that might have raged
for years, despite the fact that it would have
anastomosed with the terrible rebellion in India.
</p>

<p>
Gortschakoff was now general over the Russian
army in the Crimea instead of Menschikoff.  That
was the second change.
</p>

<p>
Many changes were taking place at home that
affected the carrying on of the war considerably&mdash;splits
in the cabinet, the resignation of a cabinet,
councils of war, and indignation meetings.
</p>

<p>
New men came to the front in the French army,
and new theories were advanced.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor of the French himself, who probably
had a hankering after military glory, had a theory.
Everybody had a theory; though, as Jack told his
friend Dr. Reikie, speaking perhaps from his early
experience in Malony's shop, theory never bent a
red-hot horse-shoe.  There is no good standing and
looking at it till it begins to get cold; the plan is to
go at it hammer and tongs.
</p>

<p>
General Neil was, against Canrobert's wishes,
appointed engineer <i>vice</i> General Bizot, killed in the
cannonade.
</p>

<p>
Canrobert, indeed, was far from very resolute, and
therefore might do more harm than good.  Good he
might have done had he taken the bull by the horns,
and resolved on a grand assault after the terrible
bombardment.  This assault was to have taken place
on the 28th of April; but on the 25th, orders had
been given to the French admiral to get ready all his
ships at once to embark the army of reserves at
Constantinople.  So this news determined Canrobert
not to make the attack.  He thought it safer and
wiser to wait for these reinforcements, and Lord
Raglan had to give an unwilling assent.
</p>

<p>
An expedition had been despatched to attack
Kertch, for through this place the Russians were
receiving all their supplies.  It had sailed on May 3;
but Canrobert recalled the French portion of it by
a fast steamer, on receiving a telegram from the
Emperor of the French to the effect that an expedition
must be made at once against the Russian army.
In the middle of May, the emperor's plans in detail
were laid before Canrobert by an officer direct from
France.  He, Canrobert, was to command the field
army, General Pelissier to take sole charge of the
siege-works with a force of Turks and French, and
the British to take to the field.
</p>

<p>
To this plan there were insuperable objections,
though it might have looked very pretty on paper to
the eyes of the French emperor, who, by the way, was
never a Buonaparte.
</p>

<p>
So it fell through.  Canrobert resigned, and
General Pelissier was made commander-in-chief of the
French army.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Pelissier was a bold and a daring man, and a most
persistent.  He had his own ideas about carrying on
war, and didn't care even for offending his emperor.
I suppose he thought that after all there was nothing
so successful as success.
</p>

<p>
Pelissier determined to do two things&mdash;to capture
an important new outwork of Todleben's, and to
send an expedition to Kertch to crush the Russians
there, and stop Gortschakoff's supplies.  He was
successful in both.
</p>

<p>
The Kertch expedition was a very pretty little
affair.
</p>

<p>
Jack Mackenzie and Dr. Reikie, whose services for
the time being could be spared from the trenches,
both found themselves once more on board the <i>Gurnet</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the map you will notice the position of Kertch
on the straits of that name.  These straits, you will
note, are narrow, and connect the Black Sea with the
Sea of Azof.  Into this latter the Don pours its floods,
and bears on its bosom the products of immense villages
if not towns that line its banks.  The largest
town is Taganrog, near the entrance of the Don to
this inland ocean.
</p>

<p>
The Straits of Kertch were well lined with batteries,
and General Wrangel, who commanded them, had it
in his power to make a splendid demonstration against
our forces.  But if he was Wrangel by name, he certainly
was not wrangle by nature; and so he not only
cut and run, but destroyed his batteries and burned
his ships of war.
</p>

<p>
If there was a disappointed man on board the
saucy <i>Gurnet</i>, it was Jack Mackenzie.  He had looked
forward to seeing and participating in a real sea-fight
of the good old-fashioned sort.
</p>

<p>
Small though the <i>Gurnet</i> was, it could have run
alongside a Russian man-o'-war and boarded; then,
once on deck, the tulzie would have been terrible.  It
could only have ended, Jack believed, in our killing
or wounding about half the defending crew, and
chasing the others below.  He even fancied himself
hauling down the enemy's flag, and hoisting in its
place the brave old Union Jack, while cheers of
victory rang from stem to stern.
</p>

<p>
But, alas! there was to be no such thing.  It
was not to be in this way that Jack should win
honour and glory and those epaulettes&mdash;or the
halo.
</p>

<p>
No doubt Sturdy was disappointed also.  However,
the whole business was a walk-over.  A very sad
one, however, for the Russ.  For the whole of the
stores intended for Gortschakoff, as well as the vessels
supplying them, were captured and destroyed.  It
was only the smaller vessels that could get through
the straits, but they did execution enough.  Even at
Taganrog they destroyed the stores and depots on the
beach, and they also bombarded and took the fortress
of Arabat.
</p>

<p>
The larger ships outside the straits made for the
coast of Circassia, and without a struggle destroyed
the fortified places at Anapa and Soujouk-kale.
</p>

<p>
By the end of June all the work was done: the
chief support of the Russian army was cut, and thus
Sebastopol was invested more easily and with far less
loss of life than could have been done by any amount
of trenching.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The stage was now being rapidly cleared for the
last and final act in this drama of war.  Already
Canrobert had driven the enemy from Tchorgoum,
and utterly demolished their camp.
</p>

<p>
It is somewhat galling to learn from Todleben
that the Flagstaff Bastion and other works in front
of the town had several times been so reduced by
our fire that had they been assaulted our success or
that of the French would have been certain, and
that Sebastopol must then have fallen.
</p>

<p>
Pelissier, and with him Raglan, persisted in his one
and main object, and that was the capture of the
Mamelon, the White Works, and the Quarries, and
these fortifications must be carried by storm.  The
emperor himself stormed in another fashion.  He
stormed by telegraph.  Pelissier tore the telegrams
up and let them blow, while he coolly acted according
to his own judgment and that of Lord Raglan.
</p>

<p>
On the sixth of June a cannonade of tremendous
proportions was turned upon the Russian works, and
carried on till darkness, doing terrible damage.  It
was resumed on the 7th.  About six the same
evening the French and Turks carried the Mamelon
by storm; and after desperate fighting, which lasted,
on and off, throughout the night, the British Light
Division and Second Division captured and held the
Quarries.
</p>

<p>
The enemy was thus once more driven back to the
rear of his former lines.
</p>

<p>
How fierce the fighting had been may be judged
from the fact that the French had lost 5,440 men, the
British 693, and the Russians over 5,000.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
On the 18th, Pelissier and our own forces made a
terrible assault upon the Malakoff and Redan.  It is
not, dear reader, because we were defeated in this
attempt (which, had not the French general been so
headstrong, would never have been undertaken) that
I do not here give any detailed account of the fighting
and the slaughter&mdash;for one should never be ashamed
to own one's faults and defeats&mdash;but because the facts
are all too well known to the veriest school-boy.
</p>

<p>
I may add, however, that after these failures I
should not have cared to stand in Pelissier's shoes,
seeing that he was acting entirely contrary to his
emperor's plans.
</p>

<p>
But Pelissier persisted&mdash;he could not very well
withdraw now&mdash;and so the siege went on, but more
methodically and prudently.
</p>

<p>
Pelissier was a kind-hearted man in the main, as
well as a resolute, daring, and determined.  The soft
or gentle side of his character is well seen at the
death-bed of poor Lord Raglan.  The general's health
had no doubt been weakened by chagrin and grief
at the reverses he had met with.  In such a condition
as this one is more apt to fall a victim to disease, and
Raglan was attacked by cholera, and quietly passed
away on the twenty-eighth of June.  And Pelissier,
we are told, stood by the bedside for upwards of an
hour crying like a child.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE RUSSIAN BEAR AT BAY&mdash;THE LAST ACT OF THE<br />
TRAGIC WAR.
</h3>

<p>
Nearer and nearer to the great fortress crept
now the works of the allied armies.  The
grip of death was tightening on the brave defenders
of Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
Brave? ah yes; give them their due.  Their sufferings
at this time were greater even than our own,
and under our fire at least two hundred of them fell
every day.
</p>

<p>
Around and in the ruined heaps of their batteries
the unburied dead still lay in heaps, and sickness,
too, was rife.
</p>

<p>
But now the great and final tug of war must
shortly come.
</p>

<p>
Could nothing be done even yet by their field
forces?  This is the question the enemy asked himself.
</p>

<p>
A council of war was held on the ninth of August,
and at this it was determined to attack our allies on
the upper part of the river Tchernaya.
</p>

<p>
This was to be the last stand of the Bear at bay&mdash;in
the open, that is.
</p>

<p>
The French had 18,000 men and 48 guns on the
heights of Fedioukine; the Italians or Sardinians&mdash;our
new allies&mdash;were near Tchorgoum, with 9,000
men and 36 guns; in the valley to the rear were the
Turks, with a reserve of 10,000.
</p>

<p>
The Russians, under Gortschakoff, held the M'Kenzie
heights, and on the night of the fifteenth of August
they were reinforced by regiments from the Belbek.
</p>

<p>
The Russian army was divided into two.  One
wing, of 13,000 infantry, 2,000 horse, and 62 guns,
was under command of General Read, and was on the
right.  It moved on to attack the French.  General
Liprandi had the left wing, divided into two columns,
one of which followed Read; the other, commanded by
Belgrade, was ordered to descend in another direction,
and halt on the road to Tchorgoum.
</p>

<p>
Next day, at sunrise, the battle was commenced by
the driving in of the Sardinian outposts.  Things
opened fairly well for Gortschakoff.  But the goddess
Fortuna had surely deserted the Russian cause; for
General Read, mistaking an order, suddenly advanced
upon the French without their position having been
cannonaded.
</p>

<p>
Both his divisions were driven back with great
slaughter, and although the battle raged long after
this, as soon as Gortschakoff saw that the French
reserves, as well as the Turks, were being hurried up
for action, he knew that all hope was past, and so
retreated.
</p>

<p>
The losses on the French and Sardinian sides
amounted to nearly 2,000 killed and wounded; but
those of the Russians showed how terrible had been
the slaughter entailed by General Read's mistake.
Three general officers and 36 others were killed, 160
officers were wounded, and of the rank and file over
6,000 were killed or wounded.  Would Gortschakoff,
now that he saw his game was almost lost, give up
Sebastopol?
</p>

<p>
At first he was greatly disheartened by the result
of the battle, and evidently intended to do so; but
he changed his mind, after a visit to the interior of
the fortress itself.
</p>

<p>
This visit of Russia's great general to Sebastopol
would have been called by sailors an inspection.
</p>

<p>
The only marvel is that, after the ghastly sights he
witnessed therein, he did not, if only out of pity for
the poor, brave defenders, give up the place at once.
</p>

<p>
The city proper had been demolished, houses were
in ruins, public buildings destroyed, whole streets
reduced to chaos.  Dismounted guns could not be
replaced even at night, owing to the fire of our mortar
batteries; the embrasures could not be repaired; nor
could the parapets that, cracked and broken, lay in
the ditches, be rebuilt.  But, worst of all, the poor
wounded men that had fallen by day had to lie
amidst heaps of slain till night permitted their being
removed.  It is needless to say that the hospitals
were crowded with sick and wounded; for the death-rate
at that time, from shot and shell and sickness,
must have been from 700 to 800 every day.
</p>

<p>
And in spite of all this, Gortschakoff determined
to re-garrison with half his army from M'Kenzie
heights, and defend the works to the very last
extremity, as "the only honourable course that remained
to him."
</p>

<p>
The last words are the tactician's own.  And yet
he knew that in&mdash;at the outside&mdash;six weeks' time he
must succumb, and yield up Sebastopol.  So these
tactics were surely unwise; nor was Gortschakoff's
resolve in accordance with true honour.
</p>

<p>
I need say nothing about the saving of life that
the capitulation of Sebastopol, just after the battle of
Tchernaya, would have effected to the allies.  The
Russian general could not have been expected to think
of these, except to wish them utterly annihilated.  But
what I do say&mdash;and I believe that my young readers
will agree with me&mdash;is that, in abandoning the great
fortress at this time, Gortschakoff could have sheathed
a sword of honour; while, by continuing the contest,
the sword which he finally sheathed was one
incrusted with murder.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The bombardment was now continued, and erelong
the Malakoff tower and the works adjoining were
silenced.
</p>

<p>
Our trenches were difficult to work, and their
advancement towards the Redan was soon put an end
to by the rocks.  As the French soil was soft, they
had worked up to within about forty yards of the
Malakoff.  Further they could not get.
</p>

<p>
It was now agreed at a council of war that the
time had come for the final and grand assault.  That
chosen by Pelissier for the advance of the French was
exactly at noon, at which hour he knew the relief of
the works he had to take was always carried
out&mdash;one garrison being first marched out, and then the
other or fresh one marched in.  At noon, therefore,
the Malakoff would have fewer defenders.
</p>

<p>
A glance, at the map or plan will show you the
work the French had before them, which was certainly
no child's play.  One division was told off to attack
the Malakoff, a second the Curtain, and a third the
Little Redan.  These would be supported by brigades.
</p>

<p>
The Central Bastion was to be attacked by no less
than four divisions well supported.  These were to
break through the rear of the bastion or works near
it, and capture the Flagstaff Bastion.
</p>

<p>
Everything being arranged, the cannonade was once
more resumed on the fifth of September.
</p>

<p>
It continued on the 6th and 7th, the mortars roaring
on all night.  It was, indeed, a circle of fire&mdash;a
<i>feu d'enfer</i>.
</p>

<p>
Todleben tells us that a mortar set fire to a line-of-battle
ship on the night of the 7th, which burned till
nearly morning, and that the blue and ghastly light
from which&mdash;for the ship contained a large cargo of
spirits&mdash;shone along the ramparts, making on the
minds of the brave defenders a most painful impression.
</p>

<p>
Our own special work was the capture of the
Redan, and it was, considering our isolated position
and want of cover, almost a forlorn hope, being undertaken
chiefly, we are told, as a mere distraction of the
enemy in favour of the French.
</p>

<p>
General Codrington himself was deputed to make
the attack with his Light Division, and with the
Second Division, commanded by Markham&mdash;the whole
numbering about 3,000 men.  Other parts of the
same division, and also the Third and Fourth
Divisions, were held in reserve in the third parallel.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Hardly had it gone twelve o'clock on the eighth of
September when Bosquet's first line made a wild dash
for the Malakoff.  Pelissier had certainly chosen his
time right well, for not a shot was fired upon
Bosquet's men, so completely taken by surprise were the
Russians.  The Zouaves were first in the attack, and
right quickly did they rush the ditch and mount the
escarp; those within were speedily put to sword or
bayonet, and this end of the great fort was thus
taken completely.
</p>

<p>
But they were not to have such easy work after
all, for each traverse or cross-work, running for 380
yards behind the tower, had to be fought for
separately and taken singly.
</p>

<p>
The Russians had been living in caves and holes
dug beneath the batteries, and they quickly came to
the defence of the fort.  The struggle was terrible
and bloody in the extreme.  Often when the Zouaves
had taken a traverse they were hurled back; only,
however, to rest for a minute, and again to dash in.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile MacMahon's forces had stormed the
place from the eastern face, and broken in at the rear
of the traverses.  Attacked thus, both in front and
rear, soon the whole was in possession of our French
allies.
</p>

<p>
But again and again Russian reserves were hurried
up to retake this fort.  But all in vain; and so, seeing
the hopelessness of the attempt, Gortschakoff finally
caused his troops to retire.
</p>

<p>
This fearful tulzie had lasted for four hours, and
deeply and dearly had the brave Frenchmen paid for
their victory, over 3,000 having been killed and
wounded.
</p>

<p>
The brigades sent against the Little Redan and the
Curtain were not so successful; for though they
stormed and took the first lines of these works,
they found other lines of defence stretching behind,
and these were so strongly defended by the Russian
field batteries and by the ships, that the French were
decimated, and obliged at last to withdraw to their
trenches, which by this time were crowded with their
wounded.  So ended the chief French attacks.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
But how about our own attack upon the Redan?
The question must be faced.  It is asked; let it be
answered.  We were <i>beaten</i>.  Certainly we may put
the blame on the mismanagement of the attack, and
on the forces and difficulties against us.  And we can
point to the bravery of our soldiers and sailors in
crossing the open space, amidst a <i>feu d'enfer</i> of grape
shot, round shot, case, and musketry.  We even got
into the work; but the reserves did not come to time,
and so we retreated&mdash;I fear not in the best of
order&mdash;suffering as much in the retreat as in the advance.
</p>

<p>
Had not the French spiked the guns in the Malakoff
which commanded the Redan, but turned them
against that fort, things might have ended in a
different way.
</p>

<p>
As soon as possible after regaining their trenches,
the British, beaten out of the Redan, recommenced
their fire against that fort.  The capture of it was
postponed till next day, when, English regiments
having failed to dispose of it, Sir Colin Campbell and
his brave and indomitable Highlanders were to have
had a chance.  Being myself a Scot and a Celt, may
I be forgiven, even by those of my readers who dwell
south of the Tweed, for believing that the kilties
would have been a little more successful?
</p>

<p>
The left wing of the French, I should inform the
reader, failed in all their attacks on the flanking
works of the Central Bastion, and were finally ordered
by General Pelissier to desist in their fruitless efforts.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, even before sunset, Gortschakoff was
withdrawing his forces across a bridge that had
purposely been built, and by means of boats to the north
and therefore safe side of the great harbour.  He had
begun to retreat early in the afternoon, and before
next day the whole army was across, and with them
as many of the wounded as could be borne.
</p>

<p>
But what a night of terror and suffering that
must have been to 2,000 desperately-wounded men,
who were left behind in a huge hospital all helpless
and alone!  For throughout the darkness of night
explosion after explosion of the magazines took
place&mdash;thirty-five in all were blown up by the enemy&mdash;and
the city took fire in every place where there was
anything to burn, adding to the scene a terror that is
indescribable.  The last explosion was the loudest
and most dreadful of all, and with it the very earth
shook all around.  It was the blowing up of the
bridge.
</p>

<p>
Our losses were very great, those of the French
treble, while altogether the Russians lost over 13,000
men.
</p>

<p>
But about those 2,000 wounded men?  Ah! one's
heart bleeds to think of their sad story.  The doctors
must, in many cases, have rushed in panic from the
poor wretches without completing their operations;
for when, forty-eight hours after the great day of
battle, the Russian vessel <i>Vladimir</i>, under a flag of
truce, came over to beg for the rest of their wounded,
only 500 of them were found alive&mdash;many whose
limbs were but half amputated being found lying face
down in their own blood on the floor, where they
had died in agony unutterable.
</p>

<p>
All the ships of war that had not been sunk were
burned by the Russians themselves, and as their
blackened and fiery hulls sunk hissing beneath the
water, the curtain may have been said to drop on the
last scene of this tragic and terrible war.

CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
"REMEMBER, WE SHALL ALL MEET AGAIN SOME<br />
CHRISTMAS EVE ON HIGH."
</h3>

<p>
Captain Gillespie of H.M.S. <i>Gurnet</i> was a
somewhat shy man.  Some sailors are.  But all
sailors are gallant; therefore when at Scutari, on her
way home <i>viâ</i> Malta and Gibraltar, the <i>Gurnet</i> lay
for a few days, and the worthy commander heard
from Jack one evening that his sister and Sister Mary
were waiting passage home, he looked over to Sturdy,
who, with our young hero, was dining with him that
night.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Sturdy, you know," he said, "though I
think petticoats are very much out of place on board
a man-o'-war, still&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know what you're going to say, sir, and I quite
agree with you.  I myself, Captain Gillespie, both on
shore and afloat, always port my helm if I see a lady;
but still&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as I said, Sturdy, <i>still</i>&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Nothing more definite was said about the matter.
Nevertheless, when at last the <i>Gurnet</i> steamed down
the Bosphorus, she had on board not only Jack's sister
and Sister Mary, but Cousin Llewellyn also.  The
ladies had Captain Gillespie's cabin, and Jack gave up
his little place to his cousin.  Poor Llewellyn had been
severely wounded in a brave attempt at saving the
life of his friend Grant.  This promising young officer,
however, was shot through the heart in Llewellyn's
arms; it was the same bullet, the surgeon said, that
killed the one and wounded the other.  There is a
sad story connected with the life of young Grant and
with his death.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* True, but the name of this young hero

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When the war was declared, his father had forced
him against his will to become a soldier, even rating
him as deficient in courage because he hung back.
</p>

<p>
"As you think I lack courage," he had replied, "I'll
go; but mind I have no hankering after a soldier's life."
</p>

<p>
Poor fellow! a score of times he had proved how
brave he was, and it was while leading a charge
against fearful odds that he fell, only wounded at first,
but slain by another bullet as Llewellyn was trying to
drag him into shelter.
</p>

<p>
The saddest thing about it is this.  A letter he
had some time before received from his parents was
pierced by the bullet and stained with the hero's
life-blood.  This was sent home to the father.  Surely a
sad memento.

Away down the beautiful Mediterranean sailed the
<i>Gurnet</i> on the wings of a spanking breeze.  The
weather was everything that could be desired, and
every stitch of canvas that could be carried was set.
After the first few days, even Sturdy got used to the
desecrating innovation of chairs upon the quarter-deck.
But it had seemed odd and dreadful at first.  Yet,
than Sister Mary and Maggie Mackenzie, no more
interesting or pretty persons had surely ever sat on the
deck of a man-o'-war.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie devoted himself specially to Maggie, and
a score of times a day Paddy O'Rayne was sent to see
if she wanted anything.
</p>

<p>
Paddy O'Rayne, the doctor's red marine, was the
same old Paddy.
</p>

<p>
All the time he had been out, although constantly
in danger in the trenches and attending to the sick
and wounded, he had, to use his own expression,
"never been sick nor sorry, sorr."  I must tell you,
however, that he was slightly disappointed because he
hadn't had an opportunity of saving Dr. Reikie's life.
</p>

<p>
"Troth sure," he told our old friend the bos'n, "it
was the bad luck was in it entoirely.  It's niver out
av danger the dhoctor was, but niver a chance did I
have to show me gratitude.  If a cannon-ball had
only taken his leg off, I'd have nursed him like a
baby; but no such luck for poor Paddy O'Rayne."
</p>

<p>
I daresay Paddy O'Rayne could see as far through
a mile-stone as a mason, so he was not long in
discovering that Dr. Reikie had lost his heart to
bonnie Maggie, as this Scottish surgeon called her&mdash;I
mean as he called her when talking to his pillow.
But having made what he considered a very interesting
discovery, Paddy O'Rayne thought he could see
his way to do the doctor a good turn, and pave the
road, as it were, for the advancement of his suit.  So
frequently, when he found Maggie reading by herself,
either leaning over the bulwarks or in her chair, he
would advance respectfully and salute military fashion.
Then he would address her in a form of which the
following is merely a specimen:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If ye plaze, miss, the dhoctor sends me to inquire
if there's anything in the wide worrld you stand in
nade av.  Nothing at all, at all, miss?  Sure and you'd
better think again.  There's nothing my master
wouldn't do to plaze you.  A dhrop o' wine and a biscuit,
miss, a pill or a plaster, or a taste o' quinine in a
tay-cup?  Well, well, miss, but sure you're not to be
shy, and it's swate my master is on you altogether.
Well, I'm going, miss; but he'd shave his head if ye
tould him to, and it's the blissed truth I'm telling ye."
</p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
One day while standing aft near the binnacle, Sister
Mary let fall her book, a volume of Burns.  Sturdy,
who was walking near with his telescope, man-o'-war
fashion, under his left arm, stooped to pick it up.  As
she smiled her thanks, Sturdy "took two observations,"
as he phrased it.  First he noticed how red her lips
were, and secondly that she had a very white wee hand.
</p>

<p>
Next day&mdash;all by chance, I suppose&mdash;he found himself
walking on the weather side of Sister Mary.  The
day after, Dr. Reikie saw him deliberately place her
chair on the sunny side of the mizzen, and put a camp-stool
beside it for himself.  Sailors, you may say, are
very daring.  Yes, granted, but then Sturdy had
begun to see the beauties of Burns, and there were
many words and expressions in it that were a
stumbling-block to him; what more natural, then, than that
he should ask this Scotch lassie to help him to their
meaning?  And so day after day&mdash;but there, I won't
go any further.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
While Sturdy was studying Burns, honest
Dr. Reikie took every opportunity of showing Miss
Mackenzie his specimens.  For during all the time he
was in the Crimea, hardly a day passed that this born
naturalist did not add to his collection.  And now
he and she dragged the sea together with little gauze
nets, and she showed herself most deft in arranging
microscopic creatures on cards.
</p>

<p>
A.P. Gribble, down in their own mess, poked lots
of fun at Auld Reikie, and now and then Lord
Tomfoozle had a shot at the doctor also in the way of
chaff; but Reikie told them both he didn't care a
boddle preen* what they said.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A shawl or plaid pin.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tomfoozle&mdash;Fitzgerald, you know&mdash;was in fine form.
I'm afraid he was somewhat worldly; for about six
months ago he had heard of his brother's death, and was
now determined to leave the service and keep hunters.
</p>

<p>
I'm greatly afraid, also, that Robert Burns, the
ploughman-poet, and the study of natural history
and arranging of specimens, had much to account for;
because before the <i>Gurnet</i> had reached the stormy
Bay of Biscay, Sturdy was engaged to Sister Mary,
and Auld Reikie was brother-in-law-to-be to our hero,
Jack Mackenzie.
</p>

<p>
Out of respect, perhaps, to the ladies on board, the
Bay of Biscay was not on this particular occasion by
any means stormy.  It was smiling and sweet-tempered,
just as if the deep sea-bottom of it were
not bedded with men's bones.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I say, Dawson," said Tom Morgan one day, "I
hear that the <i>Gurnet</i> has passed Gibraltar, and may
be expected in Plymouth Sound in a week.  Suppose
we take a run down and meet Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Hale and hearty old Dawson smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm with you, lad," he said.  "It will do us both
good.  But first and foremost I must write to the
old lady and tell her we are going.  She will be
delighted, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
And thus, reader, it happened that when Jack
Mackenzie and his friend Reikie were passing the
door of the Mount Edgecombe Hotel&mdash;let us call
it&mdash;just a day after the <i>Gurnet</i> had arrived, who
should be standing smoking a cigar at the door
thereof but big, brown-bearded Tom Morgan.
</p>

<p>
The greetings were joyous and mutual.
</p>

<p>
"But why, Jack lad, I should never have known
you.  Big and strong, and as brown as the back of
Little Peter's fiddle.  Won't your mother be proud!"
</p>

<p>
"By the way," said Jack, a minute or two after,
"how is my old friend Little Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, beautiful.  He is teaching classes, and doing
well.  Won't he be glad to see you!"
</p>

<p>
"And the Malonies?"
</p>

<p>
"Never better; in fact, never so well.  For Malony
has been a changed man since he took the pledge.
They have a nice little house now in the suburbs, and
Peter lives with them as a lodger."
</p>

<p>
That very evening there was a large dinner-party
given at the Mount Edgecombe, both Reikie and Jack
being guests.  I need hardly say that Maggie and
Sister Mary were there also, and that everybody was
happier than everybody else.  Paddy O'Rayne himself
waited behind the doctor's chair, and paid particular
attention to the ladies.
</p>

<p>
But just a fortnight after this, a much larger and
a much merrier party was held at Tom's father's
house.
</p>

<p>
It was Christmas time once more&mdash;Christmas eve,
in fact.  There never had been so large a party of
friends and relations at Morgan's mansion before.
And&mdash;will it be believed?&mdash;old Mrs. Mackenzie of
Drumglen was there herself, and, you may be sure,
occupied a place of honour.
</p>

<p>
The grandam had indeed softened as she had grown
older, and was nearing the end of her journey here
below.  "In my Father's house are many mansions,"
said our Saviour.  May it not be that, figuratively
speaking, as we draw closer that house on high,
a glimmering ray of light falls from the windows
thereof, to cheer and soften the hearts of weary
pilgrims heavenward bent?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mackenzie after dinner had the biggest chair
in the cosiest corner by the drawing-room fire.
</p>

<p>
"Come and sit by me, dear," she said to Jack's
mother.  "Take the stool there, and give me your
hand in my lap.  You are still young and beautiful.
Ah!  I wish I had known you long, long ago.  And
you dearly loved my boy?"
</p>

<p>
There were tears in Jack's mother's eyes and a
lump in her throat, so she could not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, machree, what you must have suffered!  But
look," added the old lady, by way of changing the
subject&mdash;"look at our young sailor, your boy.  See, he is
making love in a quiet way to little Tottie."
</p>

<p>
This was true.  But Violet was very shy.
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense!" she was saying, with a bonnie
blush.  "I used to write you when a baby.  I hope
you burned all my silly letters."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, religiously," said Jack, laughing,&mdash;"in the fire
of my heart."
</p>

<p>
They were standing by the window, the very
window that looked out upon the lawn where, years
and years ago, he, Jack, a barefooted, ragged lad,
had stood in the snow looking in at the fairies, as
he had called them, dancing round the Christmas tree.
The snow was falling there now; the lawn was white,
and the bushes draped like statues.
</p>

<p>
Jack sighed.  "What a change," he thought, "a
few years has made!"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Yes, dear reader mine, time works changes on us
all.  In a few years' time you&mdash;but there!  I will
neither preach nor moralize.
</p>

<p>
Only let me draw up the curtain once more before
its final fall on this my "ower true" story.
</p>

<p>
It is years after.  Where now are all our heroes
and heroines?  Well, they are scattered somewhat,
and some are dead and gone.  Let me speak of the
dead before the living.
</p>

<p>
Just one year, then, after that happy reunion at
Morgan's house, the old grandam breathed her last
in her tall four-post bed at Drumglen, and in the
presence of the Morgans and her son Donald's wife.
Her last words were these,&mdash;"Remember, we shall all
meet again some Christmas eve on high."
</p>

<p>
Jack and Llewellyn had both taken part in the
Indian Mutiny.  Poor Llewellyn was killed at
Lucknow, and died a hero's death.
</p>

<p>
Jack for his services to his country won not only
his epaulettes, but the Victoria Cross.  He was
severely wounded, however, and had to retire from
the service on his laurels.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Reikie is now a practising physician in
Glasgow, and Paddy O'Rayne is his servant.  He
married Maggie, and so, it is needless to say,
he is a frequent visitor at Drumglen, where Jack
and his wife&mdash;<i>née</i> Violet Morgan&mdash;are avowedly
the best Highland laird and lady in all the wide
Highlands.
</p>

<p>
Poor Gribble was drowned at sea.
</p>

<p>
Fitzgerald still keeps his hunters, and has grown
very stout.  I saw him only yesterday.  "Sixteen
stone and over."  he said, laughing.  "It takes a good
horse to carry me."
</p>

<p>
Fitzgerald is over fifty, but he says he'll hunt for
thirty years to come yet.
</p>

<p>
As for Sturdy, he married Sister Mary; or, to use
his own English, he got spliced.  When Captain
Gillespie heard of it, he sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Heigh-ho!" he said.  "Another good man gone
wrong.  When an officer gets married, what I say
is this: he is of no further use in the service."
</p>

<p>
But as for Sturdy, he stuck to the service, and
erelong became a post-captain.
</p>

<p>
Jack did not forget the friends of his boyhood.
He found for Malony a comfortable shop of his own
in the neighbouring village to Drumglen, and
Mrs. Malony renewed her age.
</p>

<p>
As for Little Peter, well, he is as prosperous as any
teacher of music in great Glasgow; but twice a year
he spends a whole month at the mansion-house of
bonnie Drumglen.
</p>

<p>
And so my story ends, and the curtain falls.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
